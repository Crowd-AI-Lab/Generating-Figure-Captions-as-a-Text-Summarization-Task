This task is made harder by the non-convexity of the underlying learning problems. We provide a general framework to characterize the asymptotic generalization error for single-layer neural networks (i.e., generalized linear models) with arbitrary non-linearities, making it applicable to regression as well as classification problems. This framework enables analyzing the effect of (i) over-parameterization and non-linearity during modeling; and (ii) choices of loss function, initialization, and regularizer during learning. Our model also captures mismatch between training and test distributions. As examples, we analyze a few special cases, namely linear regression and logistic regression. We are also able to rigorously and analytically explain the \\emph{double descent} phenomenon in generalized linear models.",

Stability of selected features with respect to such randomness is essential to the human interpretability of a machine learning algorithm. We proposes a rank based stability metric called instability index to compare the stabilities of three feature selection algorithms MDA, LIME, and SHAP as applied to random forests. Typically, features are selected by averaging many random iterations of a selection algorithm. Though we find that the variability of the selected features does decrease as the number of iterations increases, it does not go to zero, and the features selected by the three algorithms do not necessarily converge to the same set. We find LIME and SHAP to be more stable than MDA, and LIME is at least as stable as SHAP for the top ranked features. Hence overall LIME is best suited for human interpretability. However, the selected set of features from all three algorithms significantly improves various predictive metrics out of sample, and their predictive performances do not differ significantly. Experiments were conducted on synthetic datasets, two public benchmark datasets, and on proprietary data from an active investment strategy.",

    "paper-title": "Hardware Fingerprinting for the ARINC 429 Avionic Bus",
    "paper-abstract": "ARINC 429 is the most common data bus in use today in civil avionics. However, the protocol lacks any form of source authentication. A technician with physical access to the bus is able to replace a transmitter by a rogue device, and the receivers will accept its malicious data as they have no method of verifying the authenticity of messages. Updating the protocol would close off security loopholes in new aircraft but would require thousands of airplanes to be modified. For the interim, until the protocol is replaced, we propose the first intrusion detection system that utilizes a hardware fingerprinting approach for sender identification for the ARINC 429 data bus. Our approach relies on the observation that changes in hardware, such as replacing a transmitter or a receiver with a rogue one, modify the electric signal of the transmission. Because we rely on the analog properties, and not on the digital content of the transmissions, we are able to detect a hardware switch as soon as it occurs, even if the data that is being transmitted is completely normal. Thus, we are able to preempt the attack before any damage is caused. In this paper we describe the design of our intrusion detection system and evaluate its performance against different adversary models. Our analysis includes both a theoretical Markov-chain model and an extensive empirical evaluation. For this purpose, we collected a data corpus of ARINC 429 data traces, which may be of independent interest since, to the best of our knowledge, no public corpus is available. We find that our intrusion detection system is quite realistic: e.g., it achieves near-zero false alarms per second, while detecting a rogue transmitter in under 50ms, and detecting a rogue receiver in under 3 seconds. In other words, technician attacks can be reliably detected during the pre-flight checks, well before the aircraft takes off.",

    "paper-abstract": "We define the notion of a well-clusterable data set combining the point of view of the objective of $k$-means clustering algorithm (minimising the centric spread of data elements) and common sense (clusters shall be separated by gaps). We identify conditions under which the optimum of $k$-means objective coincides with a clustering under which the data is separated by predefined gaps. We investigate two cases: when the whole clusters are separated by some gap and when only the cores of the clusters meet some separation condition. We overcome a major obstacle in using clusterability criteria due to the fact that known approaches to clusterability checking had the disadvantage that they are related to the optimal clustering which is NP hard to identify. Compared to other approaches to clusterability, the novelty consists in the possibility of an a posteriori (after running $k$-means) check if the data set is well-clusterable or not. As the $k$-means algorithm applied for this purpose has polynomial complexity so does therefore the appropriate check. Additionally, if $k$-means++ fails to identify a clustering that meets clusterability criteria, with high probability the data is not well-clusterable.",

We focus on the system performance of hybrid precoding under a more realistic hardware network model, particularly, with inevitable dissipation. The effect of quantized analog and digital precoding is characterized. We investigate the spectral efficiencies of two typical hybrid precoding structures, i.e., the sub-connected structure and the fully-connected structure. It is revealed that increasing signal power can compensate the performance loss incurred by quantized analog precoding. In addition, by capturing the nature of the effective channels for hybrid processing, we employ a channel correlation-based codebook and demonstrate that the codebook shows a great advantage over the conventional random vector quantization (RVQ) codebook. It is also discovered that, if the channel correlation-based codebook is utilized, the sub-connected structure always outperforms the fully-connected structure in either massive MIMO or low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) scenarios; otherwise, the fully-connected structrue achieves better performance. Simulation results under both Rayleigh fading channels and millimeter wave (mmWave) channels verify the conclusions above.",

    "paper-abstract": "Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI) arose as systems that merge computing systems with the human brain to facilitate recording, stimulation, and inhibition of neural activity. Over the years, the development of BCI technologies has shifted towards miniaturization of devices that can be seamlessly embedded into the brain and can target single neuron or small population sensing and control. We present a motivating example highlighting vulnerabilities of two promising micron-scale BCI technologies, demonstrating the lack of security and privacy principles in existing solutions. This situation opens the door to a novel family of cyberattacks, called neuronal cyberattacks, affecting neuronal signaling. This paper defines the first two neural cyberattacks, Neuronal Flooding (FLO) and Neuronal Scanning (SCA), where each threat can affect the natural activity of neurons. This work implements these attacks in a neuronal simulator to determine their impact over the spontaneous neuronal behavior, defining three metrics: number of spikes, percentage of shifts, and dispersion of spikes. Several experiments demonstrate that both cyberattacks produce a reduction of spikes compared to spontaneous behavior, generating a rise in temporal shifts and a dispersion increase. Mainly, SCA presents a higher impact than FLO in the metrics focused on the number of spikes and dispersion, where FLO is slightly more damaging, considering the percentage of shifts. Nevertheless, the intrinsic behavior of each attack generates a differentiation on how they alter neuronal signaling. FLO is adequate to generate an immediate impact on the neuronal activity, whereas SCA presents higher effectiveness for damages to the neural signaling in the long-term.",

Their results hold in the noiseless case, where only false positives occur, and where only false negatives occur. We extend their results to a model containing both false positives and false negatives, developing simple information theoretic bounds on the number of tests required. Based on these bounds, we obtain an improved order of convergence in the case of false negatives only. Since these results are based on (computationally infeasible) joint typicality decoding, we propose a belief propagation algorithm for the detection of defective items and compare its actual performance to the theoretical bounds.",

Seeing the state-action value functions as an analog to the gradients in optimization, we interpret momentum as an average of consecutive $q$-functions. We derive Momentum Value Iteration (MoVI), a variation of Value Iteration that incorporates this momentum idea. Our analysis shows that this allows MoVI to average errors over successive iterations. We show that the proposed approach can be readily extended to deep learning. Specifically, we propose a simple improvement on DQN based on MoVI, and experiment it on Atari games.",

We study ambient temperature estimation based on deep neural networks in two scenarios a) estimating temperature of a single outdoor image, and b) predicting temperature of the last image in an image sequence. In the first scenario, visual features are extracted by a convolutional neural network trained on a large-scale image dataset. We demonstrate that promising performance can be obtained, and analyze how volume of training data influences performance. In the second scenario, we consider the temporal evolution of visual appearance, and construct a recurrent neural network to predict the temperature of the last image in a given image sequence. We obtain better prediction accuracy compared to the state-of-the-art models. Further, we investigate how performance varies when information is extracted from different scene regions, and when images are captured in different daytime hours. Our approach further reinforces the idea of using only visual information for cost efficient weather prediction in the future.",

    "paper-title": "Two Novel Defenses against Motion-Based Keystroke Inference Attacks",
    "paper-abstract": "Nowadays smartphones come embedded with multiple motion sensors, such as an accelerometer, a gyroscope and an orientation sensor. With these sensors, apps can gather more information and therefore provide end users with more functionality. However, these sensors also introduce the potential risk of leaking a user's private information because apps can access these sensors without requiring security permissions. By monitoring a device's motion, a malicious app may be able to infer sensitive information about the owner of the device. For example, related work has shown that sensitive information entered by a user on a device's touchscreen, such as numerical PINs or passwords, can be inferred from accelerometer and gyroscope data. In this paper, we study these motion-based keystroke inference attacks to determine what information they need to succeed. Based on this study, we propose two novel approaches to defend against keystroke inference attacks: 1) Reducing sensor data accuracy; 2) Random keyboard layout generation. We present the design and the implementation of these two defences on the Android platform and show how they significantly reduce the accuracy of keystroke inference attacks. We also conduct multiple user studies to evaluate the usability and feasibility of these two defences. Finally, we determine the impact of the defences on apps that have legitimate reasons to access motion sensors and show that the impact is negligible.",

          "It can be observed that as the network size increased, throughput tends to decrease earlier with increasing PER.",

Since Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) is the standard network protocol for communication in the internet, any wireless network with Internet service need to be compatible with TCP. TCP is tuned to perform well in traditional wired networks, where packet losses occur mostly because of congestion. However, TCP connections in Ad-hoc mobile networks are plagued by problems such as high bit error rates, frequent route changes, multipath routing and temporary network partitions. The throughput of TCP over such connection is not satisfactory, because TCP misinterprets the packet loss or delay as congestion and invokes congestion control and avoidance algorithm. In this research, the performance of TCP in Adhoc mobile network with high Bit Error rate (BER) and mobility is studied and investigated. Simulation model is implemented and experiments are performed using the Network Simulatior 2 (NS2).",

    "paper-abstract": "This thesis addresses the interplay between asymptotic hypothesis testing and entropy inequalities in quantum information theory. In the first part of the thesis we focus on hypothesis testing. We consider two main settings; one can either fix quantum states while optimizing over measurements or fix a measurement and evaluate its capability to discriminate by optimizing over states. In the former setting, we prove a composite quantum Stein's Lemma. We also discuss how this gives an operational interpretation to several quantities of interest. For the latter, we give the optimal asymptotic error rates in several symmetric and asymmetric settings, and discuss properties and examples of these rates. In the second part, the focus is shifted to entropy inequalities. We start with recoverability inequalities. Using tools developed to prove the composite Stein's Lemma, we give a strengthened lower bound on the conditional quantum mutual information (CQMI). Next, we give an operational interpretation to the relative entropy of recovery via hypothesis testing. Then, we discuss some recent counterexamples, which show that the relative entropy of recovery is not a lower bound on the CQMI; we provide more counterexamples where some systems are classical. We then turn to a seemingly different type of entropy inequalities called bounds on information combining. Using a particular recoverability inequality, we give a lower bound and additionally conjecture optimal lower and upper bounds. Furthermore, we discuss implications of our bounds to the finite blocklength behavior of Polar codes. Finally, we discuss Renyi-$2$ entropy inequalities for Gaussian states, by exploiting their formulation as log-det inequalities to find recoverability related bounds on several quantities. We apply this to Gaussian steerability and entanglement measures, proving their monogamy and several other features.",

    "paper-abstract": "Sequence alignments are fundamental to bioinformatics which has resulted in a variety of optimized implementations. Unfortunately, the vast majority of them are hand-tuned and specific to certain architectures and execution models. This not only makes them challenging to understand and extend, but also difficult to port to other platforms. We present AnySeq - a novel library for computing different types of pairwise alignments of DNA sequences. Our approach combines high performance with an intuitively understandable implementation, which is achieved through the concept of partial evaluation. Using the AnyDSL compiler framework, AnySeq enables the compilation of algorithmic variants that are highly optimized for specific usage scenarios and hardware targets with a single, uniform codebase. The resulting domain-specific library thus allows the variation of alignment parameters (such as alignment type, scoring scheme, and traceback vs.~plain score) by simple function composition rather than metaprogramming techniques which are often hard to understand. Our implementation supports multithreading and SIMD vectorization on CPUs, CUDA-enabled GPUs, and FPGAs. AnySeq is at most 7% slower and in many cases faster (up to 12%) than state-of-the art manually optimized alignment libraries on CPUs (SeqAn) and on GPUs (NVBio).",

    "paper-abstract": "Dense cellular networks (DenseNets) are fast becoming a reality with the rapid deployment of base stations (BSs) aimed at meeting the explosive data traffic demand. In legacy systems however this comes with the penalties of higher network interference and energy consumption. In order to support network densification in a sustainable manner, the system behavior should be made 'load-proportional' thus allowing certain portions of the network to activate on-demand. In this work, we develop an analytical framework using tools from stochastic geometry theory for the performance analysis of DenseNets where load-awareness is explicitly embedded in the design. The model leverages on a flexible cellular network architecture where there is a complete separation of the data and signaling communication functionalities. Using the proposed model, we identify the most energy- efficient deployment solution for meeting certain minimum service criteria and analyze the corresponding power savings through dynamic sleep modes. Based on state-of-the-art system parameters, a homogeneous pico deployment for the data plane with a separate layer of signaling macro-cells is revealed to be the most energy-efficient solution in future dense urban environments.",

    "paper-abstract": "Fog computing envisions that deploying services of an application across resources in the cloud and those located at the edge of the network may improve the overall performance of the application when compared to running the application on the cloud. However, there are currently no benchmarks that can directly compare the performance of the application across the cloud-only, edge-only and cloud-edge deployment platform to obtain any insight on performance improvement. This paper proposes DeFog, a first Fog benchmarking suite to: (i) alleviate the burden of Fog benchmarking by using a standard methodology, and (ii) facilitate the understanding of the target platform by collecting a catalogue of relevant metrics for a set of benchmarks. The current portfolio of DeFog benchmarks comprises six relevant applications conducive to using the edge. Experimental studies are carried out on multiple target platforms to demonstrate the use of DeFog for collecting metrics related to application latencies (communication and computation), for understanding the impact of stress and concurrent users on application latencies, and for understanding the performance of deploying different combination of services of an application across the cloud and edge. DeFog is available for public download (https://github.com/qub-blesson/DeFog).",

    "paper-abstract": "Many automatic attribute discovery methods have been developed to extract a set of visual attributes from images for various tasks. However, despite good performance in some image classification tasks, it is difficult to evaluate whether these methods discover meaningful attributes and which one is the best to find the attributes for image descriptions. An intuitive way to evaluate this is to manually verify whether consistent identifiable visual concepts exist to distinguish between positive and negative images of an attribute. This manual checking is tedious, labor intensive and expensive and it is very hard to get quantitative comparisons between different methods. In this work, we tackle this problem by proposing an attribute meaningfulness metric, that can perform automatic evaluation on the meaningfulness of attribute sets as well as achieving quantitative comparisons. We apply our proposed metric to recent automatic attribute discovery methods and popular hashing methods on three attribute datasets. A user study is also conducted to validate the effectiveness of the metric. In our evaluation, we gleaned some insights that could be beneficial in developing automatic attribute discovery methods to generate meaningful attributes. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to quantitatively measure the semantic content of automatically discovered attributes.",

    "paper-abstract": "Early programming languages for software-defined networking (SDN) were built on top of the simple match-action paradigm offered by OpenFlow 1.0. However, emerging hardware and software switches offer much more sophisticated support for persistent state in the data plane, without involving a central controller. Nevertheless, managing stateful, distributed systems efficiently and correctly is known to be one of the most challenging programming problems. To simplify this new SDN problem, we introduce SNAP. SNAP offers a simpler \"centralized\" stateful programming model, by allowing programmers to develop programs on top of one big switch rather than many. These programs may contain reads and writes to global, persistent arrays, and as a result, programmers can implement a broad range of applications, from stateful firewalls to fine-grained traffic monitoring. The SNAP compiler relieves programmers of having to worry about how to distribute, place, and optimize access to these stateful arrays by doing it all for them. More specifically, the compiler discovers read/write dependencies between arrays and translates one-big-switch programs into an efficient internal representation based on a novel variant of binary decision diagrams. This internal representation is used to construct a mixed-integer linear program, which jointly optimizes the placement of state and the routing of traffic across the underlying physical topology. We have implemented a prototype compiler and applied it to about 20 SNAP programs over various topologies to demonstrate our techniques' scalability.",

In this paper, we consider using massive multiple-input multiple-output (mMIMO) to provide backhaul links to a dense deployment of self-backhauling (s-BH) small cells (SCs) that provide cellular access within the same spectrum resources of the backhaul. Through a comprehensive system-level simulation study, we evaluate the interplay between access and backhaul and the resulting end-to-end user rates. Moreover, we analyze the impact of different SCs deployment strategies, while varying the time resource allocation between radio access and backhaul links. We finally compare the above mMIMO-based s-BH approach to a mMIMO direct access (DA) architecture accounting for the effects of pilot reuse schemes, together with their associated overhead and contamination mitigation effects. The results show that dense SCs deployments supported by mMIMO s-BH provide significant rate improvements for cell-edge users (UEs) in ultra-dense deployments with respect to mMIMO DA, while the latter outperforms mMIMO s-BH from the median UEs' standpoint.",

    "paper-abstract": "5G new radio is envisioned to support three major service classes: enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB), ultra-reliable low-latency communications (URLLC), and massive machine type communications. Emerging URLLC services require up to one millisecond of communication latency with 99.999% success probability. Though, there is a fundamental trade-off between system spectral efficiency (SE) and achievable latency. This calls for novel scheduling protocols which cross-optimize system performance on user-centric; instead of network-centric basis. In this paper, we develop a joint multi-user preemptive scheduling strategy to simultaneously cross-optimize system SE and URLLC latency. At each scheduling opportunity, available URLLC traffic is always given higher priority. When sporadic URLLC traffic appears during a transmission time interval (TTI), proposed scheduler seeks for fitting the URLLC-eMBB traffic in a multi-user transmission. If the available spatial degrees of freedom are limited within a TTI, the URLLC traffic instantly overwrites part of the ongoing eMBB transmissions to satisfy the URLLC latency requirements, at the expense of minimal eMBB throughput loss. Extensive dynamic system level simulations show that proposed scheduler provides significant performance gain in terms of eMBB SE and URLLC latency.",

    "paper-abstract": "Achieving secure communication between an Implantable Medical Device (IMD) inside the body and a gateway outside the body has showed its criticality with recent reports of hackings. The use of asymmetric cryptography is not a practical solution for IMDs due to the scarce computational and power resources, symmetric key cryptography is preferred. One of the factors in security of a symmetric cryptographic system is to use a strong key for encryption. A solution without using extensive resources in an IMD, is to extract it from the body physiological signals. To have a strong enough key, the physiological signal must be a strong source of randomness and InterPulse Interval (IPI) has been advised to be such that. A strong randomness source should have five conditions: Universality, Liveness, Robustness Permanence and Uniqueness. Nevertheless, for current proposed random extraction methods from IPI these conditions (mainly last three conditions) were not examined. In this study, firstly, we proposed a methodology to measure the last three conditions. Then, using a huge dataset of IPI values, we showed that IPI does not have conditions of Robustness and Permanence. Thus, extraction of a strong uniform random number from IPI value, mathematically, is impossible. Thirdly, rather than using the value of IPI, we proposed the trend of IPI as a source for a new randomness extraction method named as Martingale Randomness Extraction from IPI (MRE-IPI). MRE-IPI satisfies the Robustness condition completely and Permanence to some level. We, also, used randomness test suites and showed that MRE-IPI is able to outperform all recent randomness extraction methods from IPIs and its quality is half of the AES random number. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work in this area which uses such a comprehensive method and large dataset to examine the randomness of a physiological signal.",

    "paper-abstract": "In this paper, we study the equalization design for multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems with insufficient cyclic prefix (CP). In particular, the signal detection performance is severely impaired by inter-carrier interference (ICI) and inter-symbol interference (ISI) when the multipath delay spread exceeding the length of CP. To tackle this problem, a deep learning-based equalizer is proposed for approximating the maximum likelihood detection. Inspired by the dependency between the adjacent subcarriers, a computationally efficient joint detection scheme is developed. Employing the proposed equalizer, an iterative receiver is also constructed and the detection performance is evaluated through simulations over measured multipath channels. Our results reveal that the proposed receiver can achieve significant performance improvement compared to two traditional baseline schemes.",

          "There are two competing factors that affect the queues length and hence the delay.",
          "The first one is the number of transmissions between the sender and the receiver which affects the queuing delay at each node on the route.",
          "This factor inceases with the increase of number of SUs as shown in Figure 9a.",
          "The second one is the advantage of finding better routes as the number of SUs increases which decreases the total end-to-end delay since the probability to interfere with a PU decreases.",
          "At the first part of the graph, the first factor beats the second one.",
          "Thus, increasing SUs density increases the backoff delay and the number of retransmissions due to  the congestion at the MAC layer.",
          "This increases the queue length at each node (Figure 9c) increasing the total end-to-end delay.",
          "However, in the second half of the graph, the opposite case happens where we can see the effect of the second factor.",
          "Then, the advantage of finding better routes (and hence getting better experience for data delivery) shows upper hand over the counter effect of increasing queuing delay (due to SUs number increase) i.e. queues length decreases at each node as shown in Figure 9c.",
          "This leads to the decrease of the average end-to-end delay as the SUs density increases at the end.",
          "We can see that CAODV always has higher delay than Undercover and LAUNCH.",

    "paper-abstract": "Primary user activity is a major bottleneck for existing routing protocols in cognitive radio networks. Typical routing protocols avoid areas that are highly congested with primary users, leaving only a small fragment of available links for secondary route construction. In addition, wireless links are prone to channel impairments such as multipath fading; which renders the quality of the available links highly fluctuating. In this paper, we investigate using cooperative communication mechanisms to reveal new routing opportunities, enhance route qualities, and enable true coexistence of primary and secondary networks. As a result, we propose Undercover: a cooperative routing protocol that utilizes the available location information to assist in the routing process. Specifically, our protocol revisits a fundamental assumption taken by the state of the art routing protocols designed for cognitive radio networks. Using Undercover, secondary users can transmit in the regions of primary users activity through utilizing cooperative communication techniques to null out transmission at primary receivers via beamforming. In addition, the secondary links qualities are enhanced using cooperative diversity. To account for the excessive levels of interference typically incurred due to cooperative transmissions, we allow our protocol to be interference-aware. Thus, cooperative transmissions are penalized in accordance to the amount of negatively affected secondary flows. We evaluate the performance of our proposed protocol via NS2 simulations which show that our protocol can enhance the network goodput by a ratio reaches up to 250% compared to other popular cognitive routing protocols with minimal added overhead.",

Promising lightweight mechanisms include physical unclonable functions (PUF) and secret key generation (SKG) at the physical layer, as considered in this paper. In this framework we propose i) a novel authenticated encryption using SKG; ii) a combined PUF / SKG authentication to reduce computational overhead; iii) a 0-RTT resumption authentication protocol; iv) pipelining of the SKG and the encrypted data transfer. With respect to the latter, we investigate a parallel SKG approach for multi-carrier systems, where a subset of the subcarriers are used for SKG and the rest for data transmission. The optimal resource allocation is identified under security, power and delay constraints, by formulating the subcarrier allocation as a subset-sum $0-1$ knapsack optimization problem. A heuristic approach of linear complexity is proposed and shown to incur negligible loss with respect to the optimal dynamic programming solution. All of the proposed mechanisms, have the potential to pave the way for a new breed of latency aware security protocols.",

          "It can also noted that there is no improvement in the uplink performance after reducing SIC below 100 dB, because for this dense multi small cell network, after some point intercell interference starts dominating the total interference in the uplink direction."

Such a full duplex radio is being considered as a potential candidate for the next generation of wireless networks due to its ability to increase the spectral efficiency of wireless systems. In this paper, the performance of full duplex radio in small cellular systems is analyzed by assuming full duplex capable base stations and half duplex user equipment. However, using only full duplex base stations increases interference leading to outage. We therefore propose a mixed multi-cell system, composed of full duplex and half duplex cells. A stochastic geometry based model of the proposed mixed system is provided, which allows us to derive the outage and area spectral efficiency of such a system. The effect of full duplex cells on the performance of the mixed system is presented under different network parameter settings. We show that the fraction of cells that have full duplex base stations can be used as a design parameter by the network operator to target an optimal tradeoff between area spectral efficiency and outage in a mixed system.",

    "paper-abstract": "3GPP has recently introduced NB-IoT, a new mobile communication standard offering a robust and energy efficient connectivity option to the rapidly expanding market of Internet of Things (IoT) devices. To unleash its full potential, end-devices are expected to work in a plug and play fashion, with zero or minimal parameters configuration, still exhibiting excellent energy efficiency. We perform the most comprehensive set of empirical measurements with commercial IoT devices and different operators to date, quantifying the impact of several parameters to energy consumption. Our campaign proves that parameters setting does impact energy consumption, so proper configuration is necessary. We shed light on this aspect by first illustrating how the nominal standard operational modes map into real current consumption patterns of NB-IoT devices. Further, we investigate which device reported metadata metrics better reflect performance and implement an algorithm to automatically identify device state in current time series logs. Then, we provide a measurement-driven analysis of the energy consumption and network performance of two popular NB-IoT boards under different parameter configurations and with two major western European operators. We observed that energy consumption is mostly affected by the paging interval in Connected state, set by the base station. However, not all operators correctly implement such settings. Furthermore, under the default configuration, energy consumption in not strongly affected by packet size nor by signal quality, unless it is extremely bad. Our observations indicate that simple modifications to the default parameters settings can yield great energy savings.",

The brute-force search for the optimal user set becomes impractical as the total number of users in a cell increase. We propose a user selection algorithm based on conditional differential entropy. We apply the proposed algorithm on Block diagonalization scheme. Simulation results show that the proposed conditional entropy based algorithm offers better alternatives than the existing user selection algorithms. Furthermore, in terms of sum rate, the solution obtained by the proposed algorithm turns out to be close to the optimal solution with significantly lower computational complexity than brute-force search.",

    "paper-abstract": "A clock synchronizing circuit for repeaterless low swing interconnects is presented in this paper. The circuit uses a delay locked loop (DLL) to generate multiple phases of the clock, of which the one closest to the center of the eye is picked by a phase detector loop. The picked phase is then further fine tuned by an analog voltage controlled delay to position the sampling clock at the center of the eye. A clock domain transfer circuit then transfers the sampled data to the receiver clock domain with a maximum latency of three clock cycles. The proposed synchronizer has been designed and fabricated in 130 nm UMC MM CMOS technology. The circuit consumes 1.4 mW from a 1.2 V supply at a data rate of 1.3 Gbps. Further, the proposed synchronizer has been designed and simulated in TSMC 65 nm CMOS technology. Post layout simulations show that the synchronizer consumes 1.5 mW from a 1 V supply, at a data rate of 4 Gbps in this technology.",

    "paper-abstract": "One intriguing property of deep neural networks (DNNs) is their inherent vulnerability to backdoor attacks -- a trojaned model responds to trigger-embedded inputs in a highly predictable manner while functioning normally otherwise. Surprisingly, despite the plethora of prior work on DNNs for continuous data (e.g., images), little is known about the vulnerability of graph neural networks (GNNs) for discrete-structured data (e.g., graphs), which is highly concerning given their increasing use in security-sensitive domains. To bridge this gap, we present GTA, the first backdoor attack on GNNs. Compared with prior work, GTA departs in significant ways: graph-oriented -- it defines triggers as specific subgraphs, including both topological structures and descriptive features, entailing a large design spectrum for the adversary; input-tailored -- it dynamically adapts triggers to individual graphs, thereby optimizing both attack effectiveness and evasiveness; downstream model-agnostic -- it can be readily launched without knowledge regarding downstream models or fine-tuning strategies; and attack-extensible -- it can be instantiated for both transductive (e.g., node classification) and inductive (e.g., graph classification) tasks, constituting severe threats for a range of security-critical applications (e.g., toxic chemical classification). Through extensive evaluation using benchmark datasets and state-of-the-art models, we demonstrate the effectiveness of GTA: for instance, on pre-trained, off-the-shelf GNNs, GTA attains over 99.2% attack success rate with merely less than 0.3% accuracy drop. We further provide analytical justification for its effectiveness and discuss potential countermeasures, pointing to several promising research directions.",

The arrival rate of the harvested energy is assumed to remain unchanged during each data frame (block code) and to change independently across block codes. The harvested energy sequence is known causally (online) at the transmitter. The transmitter is equipped with a rechargeable battery with infinite energy storage capacity. The transmitter is able to adapt the allocated energy and the corresponding transmission rate of each block according to a PM policy. Three novel online PM policies are established. The policies are universal, in the sense of the distribution of the harvested energy, and simple, in the sense of complexity, and asymptotically optimal, in the sense of maximum achievable average rates (throughput) taken over a long-term horizon of blocks.",

    "paper-abstract": "The phase-field model (PFM) represents the crack geometry in a diffusive way without introducing sharp discontinuities. This feature enables PFM to effectively model crack propagation compared with numerical methods based on discrete crack model, especially for complex crack patterns. Due to the involvement of \\phased field\", phase-field method can be essentially treated a multifield problem even for pure mechanical problem. Therefore, it is supposed that the implementation of PFM based on a software developer that especially supports the solution of multifield problems should be more effective, simpler and more efficient than PFM implemented on a general finite element software. In this work, the authors aim to devise a simple and efficient implementation of phase-field model for the modelling of quasi-static and dynamic fracture in the general purpose commercial software developer, COMSOL Multiphysics. Notably only the tensile stress induced crack is accounted for crack evolution by using the decomposition of elastic strain energy. The width of the diffusive crack is controlled by a length-scale parameter. Equations that govern body motion and phase-field evolution are written into different modules in COMSOL, which are then coupled to a whole system to be solved. A staggered scheme is adopted to solve the coupled system and each module is solved sequentially during one time step. A number of 2D and 3D examples are tested to investigate the performance of the present implementation. Our simulations show good agreement with previous works, indicating the feasibility and validity of the COMSOL implementation of PFM.",

    "paper-abstract": "Accurate runoff forecasting is crucial for reservoir operators as it allows optimized water management, flood control and hydropower generation. Land surface models in mountainous regions depend on climatic inputs such as precipitation, temperature and solar radiation to model the water and energy dynamics and produce runoff as output. With the rapid development of cheap electronics applied in various systems, such as Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs), satellite and airborne technologies, the prospect of practically measuring spatial Snow Water Equivalent in a dense temporal scale is increasing. We present a framework for updating the Precipitation Runoff Modeling System (PRMS) with Snow Water Equivalent (SWE) maps and runoff measurements on a daily timescale based on the Ensemble Kalman Filter (ENKF). Results show that by assimilating SWE daily, the modeled SWE gets updated accordingly, however no improvement is observed at the runoff model output. Instead, a deterioration consistently occurs. Augmenting the state space with model parameters and runoff model output allows for filter update with previous day measured runoff using the joint state-parameter method, and showed a considerable improvement in the daily runoff output of up to 60% reduction in RMSE for the wet water year 2011 relative to the no assimilation scenario, and improvement of up to 28% compared to a naive autoregressive AR(1) filter. Additional simulation years showed consistent improvement compared to no assimilation, but varied relative to the previous day autoregressive forecast during the dry year 2014.",

A new computing model and a special kind of accelerator with dynamic (end-user programmable) architecture is suggested. The new model considers a processor, in which a newly introduced supervisor layer coordinates the job of the cores. The cores have the ability (based on the parallelization information provided by the compiler, and using the help of the supervisor) to outsource part of the job they received to some neighbouring core. The introduced changes essentially and advantageously modify the architecture and operation of the computing systems. The computing throughput drastically increases, the efficiency of the technological implementation (computing performance per logic gates) increases, the non-payload activity for using operating system services decreases, the real-time behavior changes advantageously, and connecting accelerators to the processor greatly simplifies. Here only some details of the architecture and operation of the processor are discussed, the rest is described elsewhere.",

    "paper-abstract": "During the COVID-19 pandemic, social media has become a home ground for misinformation. To tackle this infodemic, scientific oversight, as well as a better understanding by practitioners in crisis management, is needed. We have conducted an exploratory study into the propagation, authors and content of misinformation on Twitter around the topic of COVID-19 in order to gain early insights. We have collected all tweets mentioned in the verdicts of fact-checked claims related to COVID-19 by over 92 professional fact-checking organisations between January and mid-July 2020 and share this corpus with the community. This resulted in 1 500 tweets relating to 1 274 false and 276 partially false claims, respectively. Exploratory analysis of author accounts revealed that the verified twitter handle(including Organisation/celebrity) are also involved in either creating (new tweets) or spreading (retweet) the misinformation. Additionally, we found that false claims propagate faster than partially false claims. Compare to a background corpus of COVID-19 tweets, tweets with misinformation are more often concerned with discrediting other information on social media. Authors use less tentative language and appear to be more driven by concerns of potential harm to others. Our results enable us to suggest gaps in the current scientific coverage of the topic as well as propose actions for authorities and social media users to counter misinformation.",

    "paper-abstract": "Model selection methods are used in different scientific contexts to represent a characteristic data set in terms of a reduced number of parameters. Apparently, these methods have not found their way into the literature on multibody systems dynamics. Multibody models can be considered parametric models in terms of their dynamic parameters, and model selection techniques can then be used to express these models in terms of a reduced number of parameters. These parameter-reduced models are expected to have a smaller computational complexity than the original one and still preserve the desired level of accuracy. They are also known to be good candidates for parameter estimation purposes. In this work, simulations of the actual model are used to define a data set that is representative of the system's standard working conditions. A parameter-reduced model is chosen and its parameter values estimated so that they minimize the prediction error on these data. To that end, model selection heuristics and normalized error measures are proposed. Using this methodology, two multibody systems with very different characteristic mobility are analyzed. Highly considerable reductions in the number of parameters and computational cost are obtained without compromising the accuracy of the reduced model too much. As an additional result, a generalization of the base parameter concept to the context of parameter-reduced models is proposed.",

In non-adaptive group testing, the subsets to be tested are fixed in advance. By testing multiple items at once, the required number of tests can be made much smaller than $m$. In fact, for $t \\in \\mathcal{O}(1)$, the optimal number of (non-adaptive) tests is known to be $\\Theta(\\log{m})$. In this paper, we consider the problem of non-adaptive group testing in a geometric setting, where the items are points in $d$-dimensional Euclidean space and the tests are axis-parallel boxes (hyperrectangles). We present upper and lower bounds on the required number of tests under this geometric constraint. In contrast to the general, combinatorial case, the bounds in our geometric setting are polynomial in $m$. For instance, our results imply that identifying a defective pair in a set of $m$ points in the plane always requires $\\Omega(m^{3/5})$ tests, and there exist configurations of $m$ points for which $\\mathcal{O}(m^{2/3})$ tests are sufficient, whereas to identify a single defective point in the plane, $\\Theta(m^{1/2})$ tests are always necessary and sometimes sufficient.",

    "paper-abstract": "Numerical methods such as finite element have been flourishing in the past decades for modeling solid mechanics problems via solving governing partial differential equations (PDEs). A salient aspect that distinguishes these numerical methods is how they approximate the physical fields of interest. Physics-informed deep learning is a novel approach recently developed for modeling PDE solutions and shows promise to solve computational mechanics problems without using any labeled data. The philosophy behind it is to approximate the quantity of interest (e.g., PDE solution variables) by a deep neural network (DNN) and embed the physical law to regularize the network. To this end, training the network is equivalent to minimization of a well-designed loss function that contains the PDE residuals and initial/boundary conditions (I/BCs). In this paper, we present a physics-informed neural network (PINN) with mixed-variable output to model elastodynamics problems without resort to labeled data, in which the I/BCs are hardly imposed. In particular, both the displacement and stress components are taken as the DNN output, inspired by the hybrid finite element analysis, which largely improves the accuracy and trainability of the network. Since the conventional PINN framework augments all the residual loss components in a \"soft\" manner with Lagrange multipliers, the weakly imposed I/BCs cannot not be well satisfied especially when complex I/BCs are present. To overcome this issue, a composite scheme of DNNs is established based on multiple single DNNs such that the I/BCs can be satisfied forcibly in a \"hard\" manner. The propose PINN framework is demonstrated on several numerical elasticity examples with different I/BCs, including both static and dynamic problems as well as wave propagation in truncated domains. Results show the promise of PINN in the context of computational mechanics applications.",

In this work, we thoroughly investigate \\textit{soft} relaying algorithms when convolutional or turbo codes are applied. We study the error performance of two cooperative scenarios employing soft-relaying. A novel approach, the mutual information loss due to data processing, is proposed to analyze the relay-based soft encoder. We also introduce a novel approach to derive the estimated bit error rate and the equivalent channel SNR for the relaying techniques considered in the paper.",

We characterize the stability region of this feedback-based random access protocol and prove that this derived stability region encloses the stability region of the conventional random access (RA) scheme that does not exploit the feedback information.",

    "paper-abstract": "The paper is devoted to studying the performance of a computational pipeline, the number of simultaneously executing stages of which at each time is bounded from above by a fixed number. A look at the restriction as a structural hazard makes it possible to construct an analytical model for calculating the processing time of a given input data amount. Using this model, led to a formula for calculating the optimal depth of a bounded pipeline for a given volume of input data. The formula shows that the optimal depth can get large changes for small changes in the amount of data. To eliminate this disadvantage and to obtain a more convenient formula for optimal depth, a pipeline with a single random hazard is constructed, the mathematical expectation of a random value of the processing time of which approximates the analytical model of the bounded pipeline. In addition, a pipeline with two hazards has been built, the analytical model of which allowed obtaining formulas for calculating the optimal depth of a bounded pipeline with restart for a given amount of data. To check whether the proposed analytical models are consistent with the experiments to calculate the processing time, two methods of computer simulation of bounded pipelines are used, the first of which is constructed as a multi-threaded application, and the second is based on the theory of free partially commutative monoids.",

The RSFT allows for off-grid frequencies. Furthermore, by incorporating Neyman-Pearson detection, the frequency detection stages in RSFT do not require knowledge of the exact sparsity of the signal and are more robust to noise. We analyze the asymptotic performance of RSFT, and study the computational complexity versus the worst case signal SNR tradeoff. We show that by choosing the proper parameters, the optimal tradeoff can be achieved. We discuss the application of RSFT on short range ubiquitous radar signal processing, and demonstrate its feasibility via simulations.",

However, GANs are hard to train, and several aspects of the model should be previously designed by hand to ensure training success. In this context, evolutionary algorithms such as COEGAN were proposed to solve the challenges in GAN training. Nevertheless, the lack of diversity and premature optimization can be found in some of these solutions. We propose in this paper the application of a quality-diversity algorithm in the evolution of GANs. The solution is based on the Novelty Search with Local Competition (NSLC) algorithm, adapting the concepts used in COEGAN to this new proposal. We compare our proposal with the original COEGAN model and with an alternative version using a global competition approach. The experimental results evidenced that our proposal increases the diversity of the discovered solutions and leverage the performance of the models found by the algorithm. Furthermore, the global competition approach was able to consistently find better models for GANs.",

    "paper-abstract": "For practical automatic speaker verification (ASV) systems, replay attack poses a true risk. By replaying a pre-recorded speech signal of the genuine speaker, ASV systems tend to be easily fooled. An effective replay detection method is therefore highly desirable. In this study, we investigate a major difficulty in replay detection: the over-fitting problem caused by variability factors in speech signal. An F-ratio probing tool is proposed and three variability factors are investigated using this tool: speaker identity, speech content and playback & recording device. The analysis shows that device is the most influential factor that contributes the highest over-fitting risk. A frequency warping approach is studied to alleviate the over-fitting problem, as verified on the ASV-spoof 2017 database.",

During the manual tyre changing process, spinal and other muscular injuries are common and even more serious injuries have been recorded when occasionally, tyres fail (burst) during this process. It, therefore, follows that the introduction of a robotic system to take over this process would be a welcome development. This work discusses various useful applicable algorithms, Circular Hough Transform (CHT) as well as Continuously adaptive mean shift (Camshift) and provides some of the software solutions which can be deployed with a robotic mechanical arm to make the task of tyre changing faster, safer and more efficient. Image acquisition and software to accurately detect and classify specific objects of interest were implemented successfully, outcomes were discussed and areas for further studies suggested.",

    "paper-abstract": "Introduction of spectrum-sharing in 5G and subsequent generation networks demand base-station(s) with the capability to characterize the wideband spectrum spanned over licensed, shared and unlicensed non-contiguous frequency bands. Spectrum characterization involves the identification of vacant bands along with center frequency and parameters (energy, modulation, etc.) of occupied bands. Such characterization at Nyquist sampling is area and power-hungry due to the need for high-speed digitization. Though sub-Nyquist sampling (SNS) offers an excellent alternative when the spectrum is sparse, it suffers from poor performance at low signal to noise ratio (SNR) and demands careful design and integration of digital reconstruction, tunable channelizer and characterization algorithms. In this paper, we propose a novel deep-learning framework via a single unified pipeline to accomplish two tasks: 1)~Reconstruct the signal directly from sub-Nyquist samples, and 2)~Wideband spectrum characterization. The proposed approach eliminates the need for complex signal conditioning between reconstruction and characterization and does not need complex tunable channelizers. We extensively compare the performance of our framework for a wide range of modulation schemes, SNR and channel conditions. We show that the proposed framework outperforms existing SNS based approaches and characterization performance approaches to Nyquist sampling-based framework with an increase in SNR. Easy to design and integrate along with a single unified deep learning framework make the proposed architecture a good candidate for reconfigurable platforms.",

    "paper-abstract": "Humans, as both pedestrians and drivers, generally skillfully navigate traffic intersections. Despite the uncertainty, danger, and the non-verbal nature of communication commonly found in these interactions, there are surprisingly few collisions considering the total number of interactions. As the role of automation technology in vehicles grows, it becomes increasingly critical to understand the relationship between pedestrian and driver behavior: how pedestrians perceive the actions of a vehicle/driver and how pedestrians make crossing decisions. The relationship between time-to-arrival (TTA) and pedestrian gap acceptance (i.e., whether a pedestrian chooses to cross under a given window of time to cross) has been extensively investigated. However, the dynamic nature of vehicle trajectories in the context of non-verbal communication has not been systematically explored. Our work provides evidence that trajectory dynamics, such as changes in TTA, can be powerful signals in the non-verbal communication between drivers and pedestrians. Moreover, we investigate these effects in both simulated and real-world datasets, both larger than have previously been considered in literature to the best of our knowledge.",

In the study, simulations are conducted using HFSS(TM) program with Floquet Port incidence. A unit cell with two cycles of phase range and very low reflection loss is designed. 21.9% shrinkage is achieved in patch surface area using Minkowski fractals. Subsequently, proposed unit cell is used to design and fabricate a full scale 221 element reflectarray antenna. At 10 GHz, simulation results are compared with measured data and good agreement is observed.",

    "paper-abstract": "The problem of finding an electric vehicle route that optimizes both driving time and energy consumption can be modeled as a bicriterion path problem. Unfortunately, the problem of finding optimal bicriterion paths is NP-complete. This paper studies such problems restricted to two-phase paths, which correspond to a common way people drive electric vehicles, where a driver uses one driving style (say, minimizing driving time) at the beginning of a route and another driving style (say, minimizing energy consumption) at the end. We provide efficient polynomial-time algorithms for finding optimal two-phase paths in bicriterion networks, and we empirically verify the effectiveness of these algorithms for finding good electric vehicle driving routes in the road networks of various U.S. states. In addition, we show how to incorporate charging stations into these algorithms, in spite of the computational challenges introduced by the negative energy consumption of such network vertices.",

    "paper-abstract": "The performance of millimeter wave (mmWave) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems is limited by the sparse nature of propagation channels and the restricted number of radio frequency (RF) chains at transceivers. The introduction of reconfigurable antennas offers an additional degree of freedom on designing mmWave MIMO systems. This paper provides a theoretical framework for studying the mmWave MIMO with reconfigurable antennas. Based on the virtual channel model, we present an architecture of reconfigurable mmWave MIMO with beamspace hybrid analog-digital beamformers and reconfigurable antennas at both the transmitter and the receiver. We show that employing reconfigurable antennas can provide throughput gain for the mmWave MIMO. We derive the expression for the average throughput gain of using reconfigurable antennas in the system, and further derive the expression for the outage throughput gain for the scenarios where the channels are (quasi) static. Moreover, we propose a low-complexity algorithm for reconfiguration state selection and beam selection. Our numerical results verify the derived expressions for the throughput gains and demonstrate the near-optimal throughput performance of the proposed low-complexity algorithm.",

    "paper-abstract": "Novelty detection is the unsupervised problem of identifying anomalies in test data which significantly differ from the training set. Novelty detection is one of the classic challenges in Machine Learning and a core component of several research areas such as fraud detection, intrusion detection, medical diagnosis, data cleaning, and fault prevention. While numerous algorithms were designed to address this problem, most methods are only suitable to model continuous numerical data. Tackling datasets composed of mixed-type features, such as numerical and categorical data, or temporal datasets describing discrete event sequences is a challenging task. In addition to the supported data types, the key criteria for efficient novelty detection methods are the ability to accurately dissociate novelties from nominal samples, the interpretability, the scalability and the robustness to anomalies located in the training data. In this thesis, we investigate novel ways to tackle these issues. In particular, we propose (i) an experimental comparison of novelty detection methods for mixed-type data (ii) an experimental comparison of novelty detection methods for sequence data, (iii) a probabilistic nonparametric novelty detection method for mixed-type data based on Dirichlet process mixtures and exponential-family distributions and (iv) an autoencoder-based novelty detection model with encoder/decoder modelled as deep Gaussian processes.",

In this paper we analyze an idealized ground-sound model based on an elastodynamic halfspace, and use it to identify scenarios wherein ground sound is perceptually relevant versus when it is masked by the impacting object's modal sound or transient acceleration noise. Our analytical model gives a smooth, closed-form expression for ground surface acceleration, which we can then use in the Rayleigh integral or in an \"acoustic shader\" for a finite-difference time-domain wave simulation. We find that when modal sound is inaudible, ground sound is audible in scenarios where a dense object impacts a soft ground and scenarios where the impact point has a low elevation angle to the listening point.",

    "paper-abstract": "Intuitively, experience playing against one mixture of opponents in a given domain should be relevant for a different mixture in the same domain. We propose a transfer learning method, Q-Mixing, that starts by learning Q-values against each pure-strategy opponent. Then a Q-value for any distribution of opponent strategies is approximated by appropriately averaging the separately learned Q-values. From these components, we construct policies against all opponent mixtures without any further training. We empirically validate Q-Mixing in two environments: a simple grid-world soccer environment, and a complicated cyber-security game. We find that Q-Mixing is able to successfully transfer knowledge across any mixture of opponents. We next consider the use of observations during play to update the believed distribution of opponents. We introduce an opponent classifier---trained in parallel to Q-learning, using the same data---and use the classifier results to refine the mixing of Q-values. We find that Q-Mixing augmented with the opponent classifier function performs comparably, and with lower variance, than training directly against a mixed-strategy opponent.",

First, we show how to align the power-delay profiles (PDP) of different users served by one BS so that the pilots sent within one common OFDM symbol are orthogonal. From the derived aligning rule, we see much more users can be sounded in the same OFDM symbol as their channels are sparse in time. Second, in the case of massive MIMO, we show how PDP alignment can help to alleviate the pilot contamination due to inter-cell interference. We demonstrate that, by utilizing the fact that different paths in time are associated with different angles of arrival (AoA), the pilot contamination can be significantly reduced through aligning the PDPs of the users served by different BSs appropriately. Computer simulations further convince us PDP aligning can serve as the new baseline design philosophy for the UL pilots in massive MIMO.",

    "paper-abstract": "We apply the concept of artificial and controlled interference in a triangular relay network with an untrusted relay aiming at enhancing the wireless communication secrecy between the source and the destination node. In order to shield the square quadrature amplitude modulated (QAM) signals transmitted from the source node to the relay, the destination node designs and transmits artificial noise (AN) symbols to jam the relay reception. The objective of our considered AN design is to degrade the error probability performance at the untrusted relay, for different types of channel state information (CSI) at the destination. By considering perfect knowledge of the instantaneous CSI of the source-to-relay and relay-to-destination links, we first present an analytical expression for the symbol error rate (SER) performance at the relay. Based on the assumption of an average power constraint at the destination node, we then derive the optimal phase and power distribution of the AN that maximizes the SER at the relay. Furthermore, we obtain the optimal AN design for the case where only statistical CSI is available at the destination node. For both cases, our study reveals that the Gaussian distribution is generally not optimal to generate AN symbols. In particular, the conducted numerical results show that the Gaussian distributed AN is far from optimal. The presented AN design takes into account practical parameters for the communication links, such as QAM signaling and maximum likelihood decoding.",

    "paper-abstract": "Moving Target Defense (MTD) has emerged as a newcomer into the asymmetric field of attack and defense, and shuffling-based MTD has been regarded as one of the most effective ways to mitigate DDoS attacks. However, previous work does not acknowledge that frequent shuffles would significantly intensify the overhead. MTD requires a quantitative measure to compare the cost and effectiveness of available adaptations and explore the best trade-off between them. In this paper, therefore, we propose a new cost-effective shuffling method against DDoS attacks using MTD. By exploiting Multi-Objective Markov Decision Processes to model the interaction between the attacker and the defender, and designing a cost-effective shuffling algorithm, we study the best trade-off between the effectiveness and cost of shuffling in a given shuffling scenario. Finally, simulation and experimentation on an experimental software defined network (SDN) indicate that our approach imposes an acceptable shuffling overload and is effective in mitigating DDoS attacks.",

    "paper-abstract": "We present an end-to-end system for detecting and clustering faces by identity in full-length movies. Unlike works that start with a predefined set of detected faces, we consider the end-to-end problem of detection and clustering together. We make three separate contributions. First, we combine a state-of-the-art face detector with a generic tracker to extract high quality face tracklets. We then introduce a novel clustering method, motivated by the classic graph theory results of Erd\\H{o}s and R\\'enyi. It is based on the observations that large clusters can be fully connected by joining just a small fraction of their point pairs, while just a single connection between two different people can lead to poor clustering results. This suggests clustering using a verification system with very few false positives but perhaps moderate recall. We introduce a novel verification method, rank-1 counts verification, that has this property, and use it in a link-based clustering scheme. Finally, we define a novel end-to-end detection and clustering evaluation metric allowing us to assess the accuracy of the entire end-to-end system. We present state-of-the-art results on multiple video data sets and also on standard face databases.",

    "paper-abstract": "We present and apply two methods for addressing the problem of selecting relevant training data out of a general pool for use in tasks such as machine translation. Building on existing work on class-based language difference models, we first introduce a cluster-based method that uses Brown clusters to condense the vocabulary of the corpora. Secondly, we implement the cynical data selection method, which incrementally constructs a training corpus to efficiently model the task corpus. Both the cluster-based and the cynical data selection approaches are used for the first time within a machine translation system, and we perform a head-to-head comparison. Our intrinsic evaluations show that both new methods outperform the standard Moore-Lewis approach (cross-entropy difference), in terms of better perplexity and OOV rates on in-domain data. The cynical approach converges much quicker, covering nearly all of the in-domain vocabulary with 84% less data than the other methods. Furthermore, the new approaches can be used to select machine translation training data for training better systems. Our results confirm that class-based selection using Brown clusters is a viable alternative to POS-based class-based methods, and removes the reliance on a part-of-speech tagger. Additionally, we are able to validate the recently proposed cynical data selection method, showing that its performance in SMT models surpasses that of traditional cross-entropy difference methods and more closely matches the sentence length of the task corpus.",

In this paper we present the first globally exponentially convergent solution to it, assuming that the saliency is not too large. As expected in all observer tasks, a persistency of excitation condition is imposed. Conditions on the operation of the motor, under which it is verified, are given. In particular, it is shown that at rotor standstill---when the system is not observable---it is possible to inject a probing signal to enforce the persistent excitation condition. {The high performance of the proposed observer, in standstill and high speed regions, is verified by extensive series of test-runs on an experimental setup.",

          "Specifically, we tune the value of \u03c4 for the residual error-based method to get different values of expected false alarm rate based on the training dataset.",
          "The value of \u03c4 for the CUSUM statistic-based method is also tunned to get different values of expected time between false alarms.",
          "In Figure 10 and 11, we plot the values of alarm rates with different values of expected false alarm rate and the value of mean time between alarms (measured in minutes) with different values of expected time between false alarms in the four attack scenarios, respectively, comparing with the corresponding values for the real pressure measurement trace.",
          "From Figure 10, we can observe that in all cases, the alarm rates for our injected malicious pressure measurements are lower than the corresponding value for the measurements in the real trace.",
          "This indicates that it is extremely inefficient and costly (with respect to the expected false alarm rate) to detect our generated stealthy attacks using the residual error-based detection method.",
          "Additionally, we can also see that with the expected false alarm rate being less than 0.002 (0.002 expected false alarm rate means that it is expected that 2 out of 1000 detections will generate a false alarm), it is almost impossible to detect our stealthy attacks in all scenarios.",
          "Furthermore, from Figure 11, we also observe that, in all cases, the mean time between alarms for our injected malicious pressure measurements are higher than the corresponding value for the measurements in the real trace.",
          "This reflects that it is also very inefficient to use the CUSUM statistic-based method to detect our stealthy attacks.",
          "The reason for all the above phenomena is that instead of minimizing the mean square error between the predicted pressure measurements and their real values like traditional predictive models, our stealthy attack GAN is configured to directly learn how to bypass the black box anomaly detector, thus can continuously generate malicious sensor measurements with smaller residual errors The ratio of time points at which the attack goal is achieved in the attacking phase with different value of \u03b4 even compared with the real trace, making them extremely difficult to reveal by both the residual error and the CUSUM statistic-based detection methods.",
          "Lastly, we also observe from the results for the first two attack scenarios that only compromising the PLC-sensor channel can still generate highquality stealthy attacks.",
          "We believe this is because there exist unstable delays to reflect the control commands from sensor measurements, which allows the stealthy attack GAN to learn the control commands solely from the previous real sensor measurements in the sliding window S t c , making the generated malicious sensor measurements more likely to bypass the black box anomaly detector.",
          "In this section, we present another case study in which we conduct stealthy attacks using our framework onto a Secure Water Treatment (SWaT) testbed using a simulation approach.",
          "Specifically, the SWaT testbed [41] is a scaled down water treatment plant which has a six-stage filtration process to purify raw water.",
          "The general description of each stage is as follows: In the first stage, raw water is taken in and stored in a tank.",
          "It is then passed to the second stage for pretreatment process, where Fig. 11: The values of mean time between alarms (measured in minutes) in the four attack scenarios compared with the corresponding value for the real pressure measurement trace with different values of expected time between false alarms the conductivity, pH, and Oxidation Reduction Potential (ORP) are measured to determine whether chemical dosing is performed to maintain the water quality within acceptable limits.",
          "In the third stage, the Ultra Filtration (UF) system will remove undesirable materials by using fine filtration membranes.",
          "This is followed by the fourth stage, where the remaining chlorines are destroyed in the Dechlorinization process using Ultraviolet lamps.",
          "Subsequently, the water is pumped into the Reverse Osmosis (RO) system to reduce inorganic impurities in the fifth stage.",
          "In the last stage, the clean water from the RO system is stored and ready for distribution.",
          "A SCADA system with 6 PLCs, 24 sensors and 27 actuators is deployed to control the testbed.",
          "Our attacks focus on the second stage, where we inject malicious pH and ORP measurements which are larger and smaller than their real values simultaneously to change the quality of produced water."

    "paper-abstract": "Industrial control systems (ICS), which in many cases are components of critical national infrastructure, are increasingly being connected to other networks and the wider internet motivated by factors such as enhanced operational functionality and improved efficiency. However, set in this context, it is easy to see that the cyber attack surface of these systems is expanding, making it more important than ever that innovative solutions for securing ICS be developed and that the limitations of these solutions are well understood. The development of anomaly based intrusion detection techniques has provided capability for protecting ICS from the serious physical damage that cyber breaches are capable of delivering to them by monitoring sensor and control signals for abnormal activity. Recently, the use of so-called stealthy attacks has been demonstrated where the injection of false sensor measurements can be used to mimic normal control system signals, thereby defeating anomaly detectors whilst still delivering attack objectives. In this paper we define a deep learning-based framework which allows an attacker to conduct stealthy attacks with minimal a-priori knowledge of the target ICS. Specifically, we show that by intercepting the sensor and/or control signals in an ICS for a period of time, a malicious program is able to automatically learn to generate high-quality stealthy attacks which can achieve specific attack goals whilst bypassing a black box anomaly detector. Furthermore, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework for conducting stealthy attacks using two real-world ICS case studies. We contend that our results motivate greater attention on this area by the security community as we demonstrate that currently assumed barriers for the successful execution of such attacks are relaxed.",

        "From Figure 10, we can observe that in all cases, the alarm rates for our injected malicious pressure measurements are lower than the corresponding value for the measurements in the real trace."

    "paper-abstract": "Channel models for massive MIMO are typically based on matrices with complex Gaussian entries, extended by the Kronecker and Weichselberger model. One reason for observing a gap between modeled and actual channel behavior is the absence of spatial consistency in many such models, that is, spatial correlations over an area in the x, y-dimensions are not accounted for, making it difficult to study, e.g., area-throughput measures. In this paper, we propose an algorithm that can distinguish between regions of non-line-of-sight (NLoS) and line-of-sight (LoS) via a rank-metric criterion combined with a spiral search. With a k-means clustering algorithm a throughput per region (i.e., cluster) can be calculated, leading to what we refer to as \"area-throughput\". For evaluating the proposed orthogonality clustering scheme we use a simple filtered MIMO channel model which is spatially consistent, with known degrees of freedom. Moreover, we employ actual (spatially consistent) area channel measurements based on spatial sampling using a spider antenna and show that the proposed algorithm can be used to estimate the degrees of freedom, and, subsequently, the number of users that maximizes the throughput per square meter.",

    "paper-abstract": "We consider the downlink of a two-layer heterogeneous network, comprising macro cells (MCs) and small cells (SCs). The existing literature generally assumes independent placements of the access points (APs) in different layers; in contrast, we analyze a dependent placement where SC APs are placed at locations with poor service from the MC layer. Our goal is to obtain an estimate of the number of SCs required to maintain a target outage rate. Such an analysis is trivial if the MCs are located according to a Poisson point process (PPP), which provides a lower bound on performance. Here, we consider MCs placed on a hexagonal grid, which complements the PPP model by providing an upper bound on performance. We first provide accurate bounds for the average interference within a MC when SCs are not used. Then, by obtaining the outage areas, we estimate the number of SCs required within an MC to overcome outage. If resource allocation amongst SCs is not used, we show that the problem of outage is not solved completely, and the residual outage area depends on whether co-channel or orthogonal SCs are used. Simulations show that a much smaller residual outage area is obtained with orthogonal SCs.",

Recently, Natarajan, Hong, and Viterbo proposed a novel broadcasting strategy called lattice index coding which uses lattices constructed over some principal ideal domains (PIDs) for transmission and showed that this scheme provides uniform side information gains. In this paper, we generalize this strategy to general rings of algebraic integers of number fields which may not be PIDs. Upper and lower bounds on the side information gains for the proposed scheme constructed over some interesting classes of number fields are provided and are shown to coincide asymptotically in message rates. This generalization substantially enlarges the design space and partially includes the scheme by Natarajan, Hong, and Viterbo as a special case. Perhaps more importantly, in addition to side information gains, the proposed lattice index codes benefit from diversity gains inherent in constellations carved from number fields when used over Rayleigh fading channel. Some interesting examples are also provided for which the proposed scheme allows all the messages to be from the same field.",

In pursuit of such models, we propose a causal regularizer to steer predictive models towards causally-interpretable solutions and theoretically study its properties. In a large-scale analysis of Electronic Health Records (EHR), our causally-regularized model outperforms its L1-regularized counterpart in causal accuracy and is competitive in predictive performance. We perform non-linear causality analysis by causally regularizing a special neural network architecture. We also show that the proposed causal regularizer can be used together with neural representation learning algorithms to yield up to 20% improvement over multilayer perceptron in detecting multivariate causation, a situation common in healthcare, where many causal factors should occur simultaneously to have an effect on the target variable.",

    "paper-abstract": "In recent decades, the automatic video surveillance system has gained significant importance in computer vision community. The crucial objective of surveillance is monitoring and security in public places. In the traditional Local Binary Pattern, the feature description is somehow inaccurate, and the feature size is large enough. Therefore, to overcome these shortcomings, our research proposed a detection algorithm for a human with or without carrying baggage. The Local tri-directional pattern descriptor is exhibited to extract features of different human body parts including head, trunk, and limbs. Then with the help of support vector machine, extracted features are trained and evaluated. Experimental results on INRIA and MSMT17 V1 datasets show that LtriDP outperforms several state-of-the-art feature descriptors and validate its effectiveness.",

ResourceSync is a resource synchronization framework that integrates with the Web architecture and leverages XML sitemaps. We define a model for the ResourceSync framework as a basis for understanding its properties. We then describe experiments in which simulations of a variety of synchronization scenarios illustrate the effects of model configuration on consistency, latency, and data transfer efficiency. These results provide insight into which congurations are appropriate for various application scenarios.",

Restrictions are a maximum delay, or laxity, between consecutive client transmissions and a maximum bandwidth that a station can share among its clients. We study the problem of assigning clients to stations so that every client transmits to some station, satisfying those restrictions. We consider reallocation algorithms, where clients are revealed at its arrival time, the departure time is unknown until they leave, and clients may be reallocated to another station, but at a cost proportional to the reciprocal of the client laxity. We present negative results for previous related protocols that motivate the study; we introduce new protocols that expound trade-offs between station usage and reallocation cost; we determine experimentally a classification of the clients attempting to balance those opposite goals; we prove theoretically bounds on our performance metrics; and we show through simulations that, for realistic scenarios, our protocols behave much better than our theoretical guarantees.",

    "paper-abstract": "In heterogeneous cellular networks (HCNs), it is desirable to offload mobile users to small cells, which are typically significantly less congested than the macrocells. To achieve sufficient load balancing, the offloaded users often have much lower SINR than they would on the macrocell. This SINR degradation can be partially alleviated through interference avoidance, for example time or frequency resource partitioning, whereby the macrocell turns off in some fraction of such resources. Naturally, the optimal offloading strategy is tightly coupled with resource partitioning; the optimal amount of which in turn depends on how many users have been offloaded. In this paper, we propose a general and tractable framework for modeling and analyzing joint resource partitioning and offloading in a two-tier cellular network. With it, we are able to derive the downlink rate distribution over the entire network, and an optimal strategy for joint resource partitioning and offloading. We show that load balancing, by itself, is insufficient, and resource partitioning is required in conjunction with offloading to improve the rate of cell edge users in co-channel heterogeneous networks.",

More specifically, we assume each arm has a vector of covariates, there is an unknown vector of parameters that is common across the arms, and a generalized linear model captures the dependence of rewards on the covariate and parameter vectors. The problem is to minimize the number of arm pulls required to identify an arm that is sufficiently close to optimal with a sufficiently high probability. Building on recent progress in best-arm identification for linear bandits (Xu et al. 2018), we propose the first algorithm for best-arm identification for generalized linear bandits, provide theoretical guarantees on its accuracy and sampling efficiency, and evaluate its performance in various scenarios via simulation.",

    "paper-abstract": "The ability to detect, in real-time, heavy hitters is beneficial to many network applications, such as DoS and anomaly detection. Through programmable languages as P4, heavy hitter detection can be implemented directly in the data-plane, allowing custom actions to be applied to packets as they are processed at a network node. This enables networks to immediately respond to changes in network traffic in the data-plane itself and allows for different QoS profiles for heavy hitter and non-heavy hitter traffic. Current interval-based methods that flush the whole counting structure are not well-suited for programmable hardware (the data-plane), because they either require more resources than available in that hardware, they do not provide good accuracy, or require too many actions from the control-plane. A sliding window approach that maintains accuracy over time would solve these issues. However, to the best of our knowledge, the concept of sliding windows in programmable hardware has not been studied yet. In this paper, we develop streaming approaches to detect heavy hitters in the data-plane. We consider the problems of (1) adopting a sliding window and (2) identifying heavy hitters separately and propose multiple memory- and processing-efficient solutions for each of them. These solutions are suitable for P4 programmable hardware and can be combined at will to solve the streaming variant of the heavy hitter detection problem.",

What they often do is rely on \"first principles\", commonplace arguments which are relevant to many topics, and which they have refined in past debates. In this work we aim to explicitly define a taxonomy of such principled recurring arguments, and, given a controversial topic, to automatically identify which of these arguments are relevant to the topic. As far as we know, this is the first time that this approach to argument invention is formalized and made explicit in the context of NLP. The main goal of this work is to show that it is possible to define such a taxonomy. While the taxonomy suggested here should be thought of as a \"first attempt\" it is nonetheless coherent, covers well the relevant topics and coincides with what professional debaters actually argue in their speeches, and facilitates automatic argument invention for new topics.",

    "paper-title": "Encryption is Futile: Delay Attacks on High-Precision Clock Synchronization",
    "paper-abstract": "Clock synchronization has become essential to modern societies since many critical infrastructures depend on a precise notion of time. This paper analyzes security aspects of high-precision clock synchronization protocols, particularly their alleged protection against delay attacks when clock synchronization traffic is encrypted using standard network security protocols such as IPsec, MACsec, or TLS. We use the Precision Time Protocol (PTP), the most widely used protocol for high-precision clock synchronization, to demonstrate that statistical traffic analysis can identify properties that support selective message delay attacks even for encrypted traffic. We furthermore identify a fundamental conflict in secure clock synchronization between the need of deterministic traffic to improve precision and the need to obfuscate traffic in order to mitigate delay attacks. A theoretical analysis of clock synchronization protocols isolates the characteristics that make these protocols vulnerable to delay attacks and argues that such attacks cannot be prevented entirely but only be mitigated. Knowledge of the underlying communication network in terms of one-way delays and knowledge on physical constraints of these networks can help to compute guaranteed maximum bounds for slave clock offsets. These bounds are essential for detecting delay attacks and minimizing their impact. In the general case, however, the precision that can be guaranteed in adversarial settings is orders of magnitude lower than required for high-precision clock synchronization in critical infrastructures, which, therefore, must not rely on a precise notion of time when using untrusted networks.",

This paper targets at two practical issues along this line that have not been addressed before: asynchronous transmission from uncoordinated users and efficient algorithms for real-time implementation in systems with a massive number of devices. Specifically, this paper considers a practical system where the preamble sent by each active device is delayed by some unknown number of symbols due to the lack of coordination. We manage to cast the problem of detecting the active devices and estimating their delay and channels into a group LASSO problem. Then, a block coordinate descent algorithm is proposed to solve this problem globally, where the closed-form solution is available when updating each block of variables with the other blocks of variables being fixed, thanks to the special structure of our interested problem. Our analysis shows that the overall complexity of the proposed algorithm is low, making it suitable for real-time application.",

In contrast to most existing model-based reinforcement learning and planning methods, which prescribe how a model should be used to arrive at a policy, I2As learn to interpret predictions from a learned environment model to construct implicit plans in arbitrary ways, by using the predictions as additional context in deep policy networks. I2As show improved data efficiency, performance, and robustness to model misspecification compared to several baselines.",

In this paper, we consider the design of a trading strategy that performs portfolio optimization using the LSTM stock price prediction for four different companies. We then customize the loss function used to train the LSTM to increase the profit earned. Moreover, we propose a data driven approach for optimal selection of window length and multi-step prediction length, and consider the addition of analyst calls as technical indicators to a multi-stack Bidirectional LSTM strengthened by the addition of Attention units. We find the LSTM model with the customized loss function to have an improved performance in the training bot over a regressive baseline such as ARIMA, while the addition of analyst call does improve the performance for certain datasets.",

It is widely believed that recombination helps solving difficult optimization problems. We present the first result, which rigorously proves that it is beneficial to use sexual recombination in an uncertain environment with a noisy fitness function. For this, we model sexual recombination with a simple estimation of distribution algorithm called the Compact Genetic Algorithm (cGA), which we compare with the classical $\\mu+1$ EA. For a simple noisy fitness function with additive Gaussian posterior noise $\\mathcal{N}(0,\\sigma^2)$, we prove that the mutation-only $\\mu+1$ EA typically cannot handle noise in polynomial time for $\\sigma^2$ large enough while the cGA runs in polynomial time as long as the population size is not too small. This shows that in this uncertain environment sexual recombination is provably beneficial. We observe the same behavior in a small empirical study.",

    "paper-abstract": "Most of the information operations involve users who may foster polarization and distrust toward science and mainstream journalism, without these users being conscious of their role. Gab is well known to be an extremist-friendly platform that performs little control on the posted content. Thus it represents an ideal benchmark for studying phenomena potentially related to polarization such as misinformation spreading. The combination of these factors may lead to hate as well as to episodes of harm in the real world. In this work we provide a characterization of the interaction patterns within Gab around the COVID-19 topic. To assess the spreading of different content type, we analyze consumption patterns based on both interaction type and source reliability. Overall we find that there are no strong statistical differences in the social response to questionable and reliable content, both following a power law distribution. However, questionable and reliable sources display structural and topical differences in the use of hashtags. The commenting behaviour of users in terms of both lifetime and sentiment reveals that questionable and reliable posts are perceived in the same manner. We can conclude that despite evident differences between questionable and reliable posts Gab users do not perform such a differentiation thus treating them as a whole. Our results provide insights toward the understanding of coordinated inauthentic behavior and on the early-warning of information operation.",

    "paper-abstract": "To provide a better streaming experience, video clients today select their video rates by observing and estimating the available capacity. Recent work has shown that capacity estimation is fraught with difficulties because of complex interactions between the ABR control loop, HTTP server performance and TCP congestion control. Estimation-based rate selection algorithms can lead to unnecessary rebuffering events and suboptimal video quality. This paper argues that we should do away with estimating network capacity, and instead directly observe and control the playback buffer--which is the state variable we are most interested in controlling. We present a class of \"buffer-based\" rate selection algorithms that reduce the rebuffering rate while allowing us to control the delivered video quality. We implemented our algorithms inside the Netflix video client and ran a series of experiments spanning millions of Netflix users around the world. Our results show that by doing away with estimating network capacity and instead focusing on buffer occupancy, we can reduce rebuffer rates by 20% while holding video rate constant.",

    "paper-abstract": "Given a pool of observations selected from a sensor stream, input data can be robustly represented, via a multiscale process, in terms of invariant concepts, and themes. Applying this to episodic natural language data, one may obtain a graph geometry associated with the decomposition, which is a direct encoding of spacetime relationships for the events. This study contributes to an ongoing application of the Semantic Spacetime Hypothesis, and demonstrates the unsupervised analysis of narrative texts using inexpensive computational methods without knowledge of linguistics. Data streams are parsed and fractionated into small constituents, by multiscale interferometry, in the manner of bioinformatic analysis. Fragments may then be recombined to construct original sensory episodes---or form new narratives by a chemistry of association and pattern reconstruction, based only on the four fundamental spacetime relationships. There is a straightforward correspondence between bioinformatic processes and this cognitive representation of natural language. Features identifiable as `concepts' and `narrative themes' span three main scales (micro, meso, and macro). Fragments of the input act as symbols in a hierarchy of alphabets that define new effective languages at each scale.",

In this paper, we explore this concept further by using group-aided training within the distributional reinforcement learning paradigm. Specifically, we propose an extension to categorical reinforcement learning, where distributional learning targets are implicitly based on the total information gathered by an ensemble. We empirically show that this may lead to much more robust initial learning, a stronger individual performance level, and good efficiency on a per-sample basis.",

Novel approaches to solve the optimization problem in TTNPE are proposed. For this embedding, we evaluate novel trade-off gain among classification, computation, and dimensionality reduction (storage) for supervised learning. It is shown that compared to the state-of-the-arts tensor embedding methods, TTNPE achieves superior trade-off in classification, computation, and dimensionality reduction in MNIST handwritten digits and Weizmann face datasets.",

However, manipulated power flow measurements can potentially hide overloads and bypass the bad data detection scheme to interfere the validity of estimated states. In this paper, we use an autoencoder neural network to detect anomalous system states and investigate the impact of hyperparameters on the detection performance for false data injection attacks that target power flows. Experimental results on the IEEE 118 bus system indicate that the proposed mechanism has the ability to achieve satisfactory learning efficiency and detection accuracy.",

    "paper-abstract": "Big data processing is a hot topic in today's computer science world. There is a significant demand for analysing big data to satisfy many requirements of many industries. Emergence of the Kappa architecture created a strong requirement for a highly capable and efficient data processing engine. Therefore data processing engines such as Apache Flink and Apache Spark emerged in open source world to fulfil that efficient and high performing data processing requirement. There are many available benchmarks to evaluate those two data processing engines. But complex deployment patterns and dependencies make those benchmarks very difficult to reproduce by our own. This project has two main goals. They are making few of community accepted benchmarks easily reproducible on cloud and validate the performance claimed by those studies.",

This poses novel challenges to the management of these large-scale video data and especially to the analysis of and retrieval from such video collections. At the same time, existing video datasets used for research and experimentation are either not large enough to represent current collections or do not reflect the properties of video commonly found on the Internet in terms of content, length, or resolution. In this paper, we introduce the Vimeo Creative Commons Collection, in short V3C, a collection of 28'450 videos (with overall length of about 3'800 hours) published under creative commons license on Vimeo. V3C comes with a shot segmentation for each video, together with the resulting keyframes in original as well as reduced resolution and additional metadata. It is intended to be used from 2019 at the International large-scale TREC Video Retrieval Evaluation campaign (TRECVid).",

The modified arrays enable high-precision individual analog tuning of each cell, with sub-1% accuracy, while keeping the highly optimized cells, with their long-term state retention, intact. The array has an area of 0.33 um^2 per cell, and is at least one order of magnitude more dense than the reported prior implementations of nonvolatile analog memories. The demonstrated vector-by-vector multiplier, using gate coupling to additional periphery cells, has ~2% precision, limited by the aggregate effect of cell noise, retention, mismatch, process variations, tuning precision, and capacitive crosstalk. A differential version of the multiplier has allowed us to demonstrate sub-3% temperature drift of the output signal in the range between 25C and 85C.",

    "paper-abstract": "Planar homography estimation is foundational to many computer vision problems, such as Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) and Augmented Reality (AR). However, conditions of high variance confound even the state-of-the-art algorithms. In this report, we analyze the performance of two recently published methods using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) that are meant to replace the more traditional feature-matching based approaches to the estimation of homography. Our evaluation of the CNN based methods focuses particularly on measuring the performance under conditions of significant noise, illumination shift, and occlusion. We also measure the benefits of training CNNs to varying degrees of noise. Additionally, we compare the effect of using color images instead of grayscale images for inputs to CNNs. Finally, we compare the results against baseline feature-matching based homography estimation methods using SIFT, SURF, and ORB. We find that CNNs can be trained to be more robust against noise, but at a small cost to accuracy in the noiseless case. Additionally, CNNs perform significantly better in conditions of extreme variance than their feature-matching based counterparts. With regard to color inputs, we conclude that with no change in the CNN architecture to take advantage of the additional information in the color planes, the difference in performance using color inputs or grayscale inputs is negligible. About the CNNs trained with noise-corrupted inputs, we show that training a CNN to a specific magnitude of noise leads to a \"Goldilocks Zone\" with regard to the noise levels where that CNN performs best.",

We here present a software, 2D-VSR-Sim, for facilitating research concerning the optimization of VSRs body and brain. The software, written in Java, provides consistent interfaces for all the VSRs aspects suitable for optimization and considers by design the presence of sensing, i.e., the possibility of exploiting the feedback from the environment for controlling the VSR. We experimentally characterize, from a mechanical point of view, the VSRs that can be simulated with 2D-VSR-Sim and we discuss the computational burden of the simulation. Finally, we show how 2D-VSR-Sim can be used to repeat the experiments of significant previous studies and, in perspective, to provide experimental answers to a variety of research questions.",

We first improve the label likelihood estimates at superpixels by merging likelihood scores from different probabilistic classifiers. This boosts the classification performance and enriches the representation of less-represented classes. Our second contribution consists of incorporating semantic context in the parsing process through global label costs. Our method does not rely on image retrieval sets but rather assigns a global likelihood estimate to each label, which is plugged into the overall energy function. We evaluate our system on two large-scale datasets, SIFTflow and LMSun. We achieve state-of-the-art performance on the SIFTflow dataset and near-record results on LMSun.",

    "paper-abstract": "The Maximum Weighted Independent Set (MWIS) problem, which considers a graph with weights assigned to nodes and seeks to discover the \"heaviest\" independent set, that is, a set of nodes with maximum total weight so that no two nodes in the set are connected by an edge. The MWIS problem arises in many application domains, including the resource-constrained scheduling, error-correcting coding, complex system analysis and optimization, and communication networks. Since solving the MWIS problem is the core function for finding the optimum solution of our novel graph-based formulation of the resource-constrained Process Planning and Scheduling (PPS) problem, it is essential to have \"good-performance\" algorithms to solve the MWIS problem. In this paper, we propose a Novel Hybrid Heuristic Algorithm (NHHA) framework in a divide-and-conquer structure that yields optimum feasible solutions to the MWIS problem. The NHHA framework is optimized to minimize the recurrence. Using the NHHA framework, we also solve the All Maximal Independent Sets Listing (AMISL) problem, which can be seen as the subproblem of the MWIS problem. Moreover, building composed MWIS algorithms that utilizing fast approximation algorithms with the NHHA framework is an effective way to improve the accuracy of approximation MWIS algorithms (e.g., GWMIN and GWMIN2 (Sakai et al., 2003)). Eight algorithms for the MWIS problem, the exact MWIS algorithm, the AMISL algorithm, two approximation algorithms from the literature, and four composed algorithms, are applied and tested for solving the graph-based formulation of the resource-constrained PPS problem to evaluate the scalability, accuracy, and robustness.",

    "paper-abstract": "Power systems are subject to fundamental changes due to the increasing infeed of renewable energy sources. Taking the accompanying decentralization of power generation into account, the concept of prosumer-based microgrids gives the opportunity to rethink structuring and operation of power systems from scratch. In a prosumer-based microgrid, each power grid node can feed energy into the grid and draw energy from the grid. The concept allows for spatial aggregation such that also an interaction between microgrids can be represented as a prosumer-based microgrid. The contribution of this work is threefold: (i) we propose a decentralized hierarchical control approach in a network including different time scales, (ii) we use iterative learning control to compensate periodic demand patterns and save lower layer control energy and (iii) we assure asymptotic stability and monotonic convergence in the iteration domain for the linearized dynamics and validate the performance by simulating the nonlinear dynamics.",

    "paper-abstract": "This paper proposes an asymptotically optimal hybrid beamforming solution for large antenna arrays by exploiting the properties of the singular vectors of the channel matrix. It is shown that the elements of the channel matrix with Rayleigh fading follow a normal distribution when large antenna arrays are employed. The proposed beamforming algorithm is effective in both sparse and rich propagation environments, and is applicable for both point-to-point and multiuser scenarios. In addition, a closed-form expression and a lower-bound for the achievable rates are derived when analog and digital phase shifters are employed. It is shown that the performance of the hybrid beamformers using phase shifters with more than 2-bits resolution is comparable with analog phase shifting. A novel phase shifter selection scheme that reduces the power consumption at the phase shifter network is proposed when the wireless channel is modeled by Rayleigh fading. Using this selection scheme, the spectral efficiency can be increased as the power consumption in the phase shifter network reduces. Compared to the scenario that all of the phase shifters are in operation, the simulation results indicate that the spectral efficiency increases when up to 50% of phase shifters are turned off.",

Armed with the realization that a backup system has peculiar requirements -- namely, data is read over the network only during restore processes caused by data loss -- redundancy management targets data durability rather than attempting to make each piece of information availabile at any time. In our approach each peer determines, in an on-line manner, an amount of redundancy sufficient to counter the effects of peer deaths, while preserving acceptable data restore times. Our experiments, based on trace-driven simulations, indicate that our mechanism can reduce the redundancy by a factor between two and three with respect to redundancy policies aiming for data availability. These results imply an according increase in storage capacity and decrease in time to complete backups, at the expense of longer times required to restore data. We believe this is a very reasonable price to pay, given the nature of the application. We complete our work with a discussion on practical issues, and their solutions, related to which encoding technique is more suitable to support our scheme.",

    "paper-abstract": "A celebrated technique for finding near neighbors for the angular distance involves using a set of \\textit{random} hyperplanes to partition the space into hash regions [Charikar, STOC 2002]. Experiments later showed that using a set of \\textit{orthogonal} hyperplanes, thereby partitioning the space into the Voronoi regions induced by a hypercube, leads to even better results [Terasawa and Tanaka, WADS 2007]. However, no theoretical explanation for this improvement was ever given, and it remained unclear how the resulting hypercube hash method scales in high dimensions. In this work, we provide explicit asymptotics for the collision probabilities when using hypercubes to partition the space. For instance, two near-orthogonal vectors are expected to collide with probability $(\\frac{1}{\\pi})^{d + o(d)}$ in dimension $d$, compared to $(\\frac{1}{2})^d$ when using random hyperplanes. Vectors at angle $\\frac{\\pi}{3}$ collide with probability $(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{\\pi})^{d + o(d)}$, compared to $(\\frac{2}{3})^d$ for random hyperplanes, and near-parallel vectors collide with similar asymptotic probabilities in both cases. For $c$-approximate nearest neighbor searching, this translates to a decrease in the exponent $\\rho$ of locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) methods of a factor up to $\\log_2(\\pi) \\approx 1.652$ compared to hyperplane LSH. For $c = 2$, we obtain $\\rho \\approx 0.302 + o(1)$ for hypercube LSH, improving upon the $\\rho \\approx 0.377$ for hyperplane LSH. We further describe how to use hypercube LSH in practice, and we consider an example application in the area of lattice algorithms.",

It undercuts the time spent in the rest of the airport, and therefore the revenue that could be generated from shopping and dining. It can also result in passengers missing flights and connections, which has significant operational repercussions. Inadequate staffing levels are often to blame for large congestion at an airport. In this paper, we present a stochastic simulation that estimates the operational uncertainty in passenger processing at immigration. Congestion and delays are estimated on arrivals and departures based on scheduled flight departures and arrivals. We demonstrate the use of cellular tracking data in refining the model, and an approach to controlling congestion by adjusting staffing levels.",

We developed a novel deep neural network model based on Fully Gated CNN, supported by Multiple bidirectional GRU and Attention mechanisms to manipulate sophisticated features that achieve 0.045 Character Error Rate (CER), 0.192 Word Error Rate (WER) and 0.253 Sequence Error Rate (SER) for the first test dataset and 0.064 CER, 0.24 WER and 0.361 SER for the second test dataset. Also, we propose fully gated layers by taking the advantage of multiple the output feature from Tahn and input feature, this proposed work achieves better results and We experimented with our model on the Handwritten Kazakh & Russian Database (HKR). Our research is the first work on the HKR dataset and demonstrates state-of-the-art results to most of the other existing models.",

    "paper-abstract": "Batch Normalization is a commonly used trick to improve the training of deep neural networks. These neural networks use L2 regularization, also called weight decay, ostensibly to prevent overfitting. However, we show that L2 regularization has no regularizing effect when combined with normalization. Instead, regularization has an influence on the scale of weights, and thereby on the effective learning rate. We investigate this dependence, both in theory, and experimentally. We show that popular optimization methods such as ADAM only partially eliminate the influence of normalization on the learning rate. This leads to a discussion on other ways to mitigate this issue.",

    "paper-title": "MemJam: A False Dependency Attack against Constant-Time Crypto Implementations",
    "paper-abstract": "Cache attacks exploit memory access patterns of cryptographic implementations. Constant-Time implementation techniques have become an indispensable tool in fighting cache timing attacks. These techniques engineer the memory accesses of cryptographic operations to follow a uniform key independent pattern. However, the constant-time behavior is dependent on the underlying architecture, which can be highly complex and often incorporates unpublished features. CacheBleed attack targets cache bank conflicts and thereby invalidates the assumption that microarchitectural side-channel adversaries can only observe memory with cache line granularity. In this work, we propose MemJam, a side-channel attack that exploits false dependency of memory read-after-write and provides a high quality intra cache level timing channel. As a proof of concept, we demonstrate the first key recovery attacks on a constant-time implementation of AES, and a SM4 implementation with cache protection in the current Intel Integrated Performance Primitives (Intel IPP) cryptographic library. Further, we demonstrate the first intra cache level timing attack on SGX by reproducing the AES key recovery results on an enclave that performs encryption using the aforementioned constant-time implementation of AES. Our results show that we can not only use this side channel to efficiently attack memory dependent cryptographic operations but also to bypass proposed protections. Compared to CacheBleed, which is limited to older processor generations, MemJam is the first intra cache level attack applicable to all major Intel processors including the latest generations that support the SGX extension.",

    "paper-abstract": "Recent applications of unmanned aerial systems (UAS) to precision agriculture have shown increased ease and efficiency in data collection at precise remote locations. However, further enhancement of the field requires operation over long periods of time, e.g. days or weeks. This has so far been impractical due to the limited flight times of such platforms and the requirement of humans in the loop for operation. To overcome these limitations, we propose a fully autonomous rotorcraft UAS that is capable of performing repeated flights for long-term observation missions without any human intervention. We address two key technologies that are critical for such a system: full platform autonomy to enable mission execution independently from human operators and the ability of vision-based precision landing on a recharging station for automated energy replenishment. High-level autonomous decision making is implemented as a hierarchy of master and slave state machines. Vision-based precision landing is enabled by estimating the landing pad's pose using a bundle of AprilTag fiducials configured for detection from a wide range of altitudes. We provide an extensive evaluation of the landing pad pose estimation accuracy as a function of the bundle's geometry. The functionality of the complete system is demonstrated through two indoor experiments with a duration of 11 and 10.6 hours, and one outdoor experiment with a duration of 4 hours. The UAS executed 16, 48 and 22 flights respectively during these experiments. In the outdoor experiment, the ratio between flying to collect data and charging was 1 to 10, which is similar to past work in this domain. All flights were fully autonomous with no human in the loop. To our best knowledge this is the first research publication about the long-term outdoor operation of a quadrotor system with no human interaction.",

    "paper-abstract": "The society as a whole, and many vertical sectors in particular, is becoming increasingly digitalized. Machine Type Communication (MTC), encompassing its massive and critical aspects, and ubiquitous wireless connectivity are among the main enablers of such digitization at large. The recently introduced 5G New Radio is natively designed to support both aspects of MTC to promote the digital transformation of the society. However, it is evident that some of the more demanding requirements cannot be fully supported by 5G networks. Alongside, further development of the society towards 2030 will give rise to new and more stringent requirements on wireless connectivity in general, and MTC in particular. Driven by the societal trends towards 2030, the next generation (6G) will be an agile and efficient convergent network serving a set of diverse service classes and a wide range of key performance indicators (KPI). This white paper explores the main drivers and requirements of an MTC-optimized 6G network, and discusses the following six key research questions: - Will the main KPIs of 5G continue to be the dominant KPIs in 6G; or will there emerge new key metrics? - How to deliver different E2E service mandates with different KPI requirements considering joint-optimization at the physical up to the application layer? - What are the key enablers towards designing ultra-low power receivers and highly efficient sleep modes? - How to tackle a disruptive rather than incremental joint design of a massively scalable waveform and medium access policy for global MTC connectivity? - How to support new service classes characterizing mission-critical and dependable MTC in 6G? - What are the potential enablers of long term, lightweight and flexible privacy and security schemes considering MTC device requirements?",

We first examine an approximate deterministic formulation of the problem, and introduce the complementarity conditions that capture the use of Gaussian coding and successive decoding. In the deterministic channel problem, we find the constrained sum-capacity and its achievable schemes with the minimum number of messages, first in symmetric channels, and then in general asymmetric channels. We show that the constrained sum-capacity oscillates as a function of the cross link gain parameters between the information theoretic sum-capacity and the sum-capacity with interference treated as noise. Furthermore, we show that if the number of messages of either of the two users is fewer than the minimum number required to achieve the constrained sum-capacity, the maximum achievable sum-rate drops to that with interference treated as noise. We provide two algorithms (a simple one and a finer one) to translate the optimal schemes in the deterministic channel model to the Gaussian channel model. We also derive two upper bounds on the sum-capacity of the Gaussian Han-Kobayashi schemes, which automatically upper bound the sum-capacity using successive decoding of Gaussian codewords. Numerical evaluations show that, similar to the deterministic channel results, the constrained sum-capacity in the Gaussian channels oscillates between the sum-capacity with Han-Kobayashi schemes and that with single message schemes.",

Practical video streaming systems usually use some form of HTTP streaming (progressive download) to let users download the video at a faster rate than the video bitrate. Since users may quit before viewing the complete video, however, much of the downloaded video will be \"wasted\". To the extent that users' departure behavior can be predicted, we develop smart streaming that can be used to improve user QoE with limited server bandwidth or save bandwidth cost with unlimited server bandwidth. Through measurement, we extract certain user behavior properties for implementing such smart streaming, and demonstrate its advantage using prototype implementation as well as simulations.",

Our approach does not impose any assumptions on how words are to be combined into a sentence representation. We discuss a simple Bag of Words model as well as a variant that models word positions. Both are trained to reconstruct the sentence based on a latent code and our model can be used to generate text. Experiments show large improvements over the related Paragraph Vectors. Compared to uSIF, we achieve a relative improvement of 5% when trained on the same data and our method performs competitively to Sent2vec while trained on 30 times less data.",

    "paper-abstract": "There is the long-standing assumption that radio communication in the range of hundreds of meters needs to consume mWs of power at the transmitting device. In this paper, we demonstrate that this is not necessarily the case for some devices equipped with backscatter radios. We present LoRea an architecture consisting of a tag, a reader and multiple carrier generators that overcomes the power, cost and range limitations of existing systems such as Computational Radio Frequency Identification~(CRFID). LoRea achieves this by: First, generating narrow-band backscatter transmissions that improve receiver sensitivity. Second, mitigating self-interference without the complex designs employed on RFID readers by keeping carrier signal and backscattered signal apart in frequency. Finally, decoupling carrier generation from the reader and using devices such as WiFi routers and sensor nodes as a source of the carrier signal. An off-the-shelf implementation of LoRea costs 70 USD, a drastic reduction in price considering commercial RFID readers cost 2000 USD. LoRea's range scales with the carrier strength, and proximity to the carrier source and achieves a maximum range of 3.4 kilometre when the tag is located at 1 meter distance from a 28 dBm carrier source while consuming 70 microwatts at the tag. When the tag is equidistant from the carrier source and the receiver, we can communicate upto 75 meter, a significant improvement over existing RFID readers.",

          "In addition, there is a slight concentration of abused NTP servers connected to one Taiwanese AS and two United States network operators.",
          "This might indicate a potential to focus notification and patching efforts on these networks, given the limited pool of hosts used for Chargen and NTP attacks from Table 5.",
          "Feeds of these actively abused servers could also be distributed to these network operators and to DDoS mitigation services.",

    "paper-abstract": "DDoS-for-hire services, also known as booters, have commoditized DDoS attacks and enabled abusive subscribers of these services to cheaply extort, harass and intimidate businesses and people by knocking them offline. However, due to the underground nature of these booters, little is known about their underlying technical and business structure. In this paper we empirically measure many facets of their technical and payment infrastructure. We also perform an analysis of leaked and scraped data from three major booters---Asylum Stresser, Lizard Stresser and VDO---which provides us with an in-depth view of their customers and victims. Finally, we conduct a large-scale payment intervention in collaboration with PayPal and evaluate its effectiveness. Based on our analysis we show that these services are responsible for hundreds of thousands of DDoS attacks and identify potentially promising methods of increasing booters' costs and undermining these services.",

It is modelled as a two-user multiple access diamond channel. It consists of a first hop from the central processor to the base stations via orthogonal links of finite capacity, and the second hop from the base stations to the mobile users via a Gaussian interference channel. The converse is derived using the converse tools of the multiple access diamond channel and that of the Gaussian MIMO broadcast channel. Through numerical results, it is shown that our upper bound improves upon the existing upper bound greatly in the medium backhaul capacity range, and as a result, the gap between the upper bounds and the sum rate of the time-sharing of the known achievable schemes is significantly reduced.",

In this paper, the issues surrounding the Parrondo's paradox are investigated. The focus is lying on testifying whether the same paradoxical effect can be reproduced by using a simple capital dependent game. The paradoxical effect generated by the Parrondo's paradox can be explained by placing all the parameters in one probability space. Based on this framework, it is able to generate other possible paradoxical effects by manipulating the parameters in the probability space.",

    "paper-abstract": "Automated fraud behaviors detection on electronic payment platforms is a tough problem. Fraud users often exploit the vulnerability of payment platforms and the carelessness of users to defraud money, steal passwords, do money laundering, etc, which causes enormous losses to digital payment platforms and users. There are many challenges for fraud detection in practice. Traditional fraud detection methods require a large-scale manually labeled dataset, which is hard to obtain in reality. Manually labeled data cost tremendous human efforts. Besides, the continuous and rapid evolution of fraud users makes it hard to find new fraud patterns based on existing detection rules. In our work, we propose a real-world data oriented detection paradigm which can detect fraud users and upgrade its detection ability automatically. Based on the new paradigm, we design a novel fraud detection model, FraudJudger, to analyze users behaviors on digital payment platforms and detect fraud users with fewer labeled data in training. FraudJudger can learn the latent representations of users from unlabeled data with the help of Adversarial Autoencoder (AAE). Furthermore, FraudJudger can find new fraud patterns from unknown users by cluster analysis. Our experiment is based on a real-world electronic payment dataset. Comparing with other well-known fraud detection methods, FraudJudger can achieve better detection performance with only 10% labeled data.",

    "paper-abstract": "In this paper, we investigate opportunistic relaying and jamming techniques and develop relay selection algorithms that maximize the secrecy rate for multiuser buffer-aided relay networks. We develop an approach to maximize the secrecy rate of relay systems that does not require the channel state information (CSI) of the eavesdroppers. We also devise relaying and jamming function selection (RJFS) algorithms to select multiple relay nodes as well as multiple jamming nodes to assist the transmission. In the proposed RJFS algorithms inter-relay interference cancellation (IC) is taken into account. IC is first performed to improve the transmission rate to legitimate users and then inter-relay IC is applied to amplify the jamming signal to the eavesdroppers and enhance the secrecy rate. With the buffer-aided relays the jamming signal can be stored at the relay nodes and a buffer-aided RJFS (BF-RJFS) algorithm is proposed. Greedy RJFS and BF-RJFS algorithms are then developed for relay selection with reduced complexity. Simulation results show that the proposed RJFS and BF-RJFS algorithms can achieve a higher secrecy rate performance than previously reported techniques even in the absence of CSI of the eavesdroppers.",

    "paper-abstract": "For ultra-dense networks with wireless backhaul, caching strategy at small base stations (SBSs), usually with limited storage, is critical to meet massive high data rate requests. Since the content popularity profile varies with time in an unknown way, we exploit reinforcement learning (RL) to design a cooperative caching strategy with maximum-distance separable (MDS) coding. We model the MDS coding based cooperative caching as a Markov decision process to capture the popularity dynamics and maximize the long-term expected cumulative traffic load served directly by the SBSs without accessing the macro base station. For the formulated problem, we first find the optimal solution for a small-scale system by embedding the cooperative MDS coding into Q-learning. To cope with the large-scale case, we approximate the state-action value function heuristically. The approximated function includes only a small number of learnable parameters and enables us to propose a fast and efficient action-selection approach, which dramatically reduces the complexity. Numerical results verify the optimality/near-optimality of the proposed RL based algorithms and show the superiority compared with the baseline schemes. They also exhibit good robustness to different environments.",

    "paper-abstract": "The monograph represents analysis of the possibility for time-optimal control of a prototype of an aircraft-mounted scanning-imaging system of a Light Detection and Ranging based wake vortex detection system. The study is a part of the research project \"Demonstration of Light Detection and Ranging based wake vortex detection system incorporating an atmospheric hazard map\" or GREEN-WAKE (Project ID 213254) of the European Union Seventh Framework Program for Research and Technological Development. The scanning system comprises two light mirror actuators. The study is decomposed into several group of problems. The first and second groups consider the mathematical models of the scanning system and the mirror actuators. The third group of problems deals with the design of closed loop tracking control systems of both the large and small mirror actuators. The control of each one system is synthesized as a near time-optimal control of the precise linear model of the mirror actuator. The control algorithms realize the state of the art method for synthesis of time-optimal control of any order for a class of linear time-optimal control problems developed in the author's dissertation. The last discovers and theoretically proves new properties of a class of linear time-optimal control problems. From the point of view of the control synthesis algorithms the main advantage is that the time-optimal control is produced by a multistage procedure within the class of problems but without the need of describing the hyper-surfaces of switching over. The fourth group of problems considers modeling the real scan picture but with inclusion also of the Coulomb's friction model. The fifth group of problems investigates the ways of improvement of the real scan picture. As a result an excellent repetition and clearness of the scanning alongside with symmetry and matching the scan pattern are seen.",

We reveal which problems in unbalanced optimal transport can/cannot be solved efficiently. Specifically, we prove that the Kantorovich Rubinstein distance and optimal partial transport in Euclidean metric cannot be computed in strongly subquadratic time under the strong exponential time hypothesis. Then, we propose an algorithm that solves a more general unbalanced optimal transport problem exactly in quasi-linear time on a tree metric. The proposed algorithm processes a tree with one million nodes in less than one second. Our analysis forms a foundation for the theoretical study of unbalanced optimal transport algorithms and opens the door to the applications of unbalanced optimal transport to million-scale datasets.",

          "When comparing the number of repository forks with the deployments of cloud functions, one remarkable development is that forks exceed deployments.",
          "This means that repositories of many cloud functions are often cloned, perhaps in a hoarding manner.",

          "A particular counterexample is s3-presigned-url which is forked a lot (1169 times) but hardly deployed (34).",

Beside Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) and Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS) systems, developer-oriented tools such as deployment and debugging frameworks as well as cloud function repositories enable the rapid creation of wholly or partially serverless applications. This study presents first insights into how cloud functions (Lambda functions) and composite serverless applications offered through the AWS Serverless Application Repository have evolved over the course of one year. Specifically, it outlines information on cloud function and function-based application offering models and descriptions, high-level implementation statistics, and evolution including change patterns over time. Several results are presented in live paper style, offering hyperlinks to continuously updated figures to follow the evolution after publication date.",

          "On the other hand, a number of training symbols above 30 does not improve the EVM anymore, which leads to a constant degradation between Perfect IA IA of around 4 dB.",
          "The fact that the EVM does not improve when increasing the number of training symbols suggests that the performance of IA is not only limited by imperfect CSI but also by other spurious effects, such as those derived from reusing the same training sequence and thus exciting the same nonlinearities each time.",
          "Notice also that the gap between post-FFT and pre-FFT decoding is substantially higher for IA than for Perfect IA.",
          "This is due to the fact that, for the latter case, the degradation between both decoding schemes is caused by the additional ISI introduced by the pre-FFT decoding process (since the MUI has been avoided by sequential transmissions), whereas for the former case is due to ISI and residual MUI (see Fig. 13).",
          "Additionally, the impact of transmitter noise is also lower for Perfect IA since a single user is transmitting at a time instead of three simultaneously, as in the case of pre-FFT or post-FFT IA. precoders and decoders are outdated by the time the aligned precoded transmission is actually performed.",
          "To evaluate this hypothesis, we conducted an additional experiment where a deliberate feedback time was introduced 2 .",
          "The results in Fig. 15 show that increasing feedback time does not cause additional degradation of the received signal EVM, hence proving the channel remains static for at least 10 seconds.",

          "This is consistent with the special care taken to guarantee that our measurement scenario is completely static (see Section IV).",

Experiments have been carried out using a wireless network testbed capable of implementing a 3-user MIMO interference channel. We have implemented IA decoding schemes that can be designed according to distinct criteria (e.g. zero-forcing or MaxSINR). The measurement methodology has been validated considering practical issues like the number of OFDM training symbols used for channel estimation or feedback time. In case of asynchronous users, a time-domain IA decoding filter is also compared to its frequency-domain counterpart. We also evaluated the performance of IA from bit error rate measurement-based results in comparison to different time-division multiple access transmission schemes. The comparison includes single- and multiple-antenna systems transmitting over the dominant mode of the MIMO channel. Our results indicate that spatial IA is suitable for practical indoor scenarios in which wireless channels often exhibit relatively large coherence times.",

In contention-based transmission, the random pilot collision is a challenging problem. To solve this problem, multiple pilots scheme is used to reduce the pilot collision probabliltiy. However, the existing work on multiple pilots relies on the low correlation of spatial channels, limiting its applicability. In this paper, an independent multi-pilot scheme is proposed, which utilizes the diversity of multiple pilots and is not limited by the spatial correlation. The receiver employs interference cancellation for both data symbols and multiple pilots to ensure the performance. The simulation results also show that the proposed independent multi-pilot scheme can significantly improve the BLER performance and increase the number of simultaneous access users.",

The goal is to design algorithms that update the solution efficiently with each arrival rather than recomputing it from scratch. In this work, we focus on $k$-clustering problems such as $k$-means and $k$-median. In this setting, we provide simple and practical algorithms that offer stronger performance guarantees than previous results. Empirically, we show that our methods store only a small fraction of the data, are orders of magnitude faster, and find solutions with costs only slightly higher than those returned by algorithms with access to the full dataset.",

This paper proposes a mode-domain feedforward ANC method to attenuate the noise field over a large space while reducing the number of microphones required. We adopt a sparse reference signal representation to precisely calculate the reference mode coefficients. The proposed system consists of circular reference and error microphone arrays, which capture the reference noise signal and residual error signal, respectively, and a circular loudspeaker array to drive the anti-noise signal. Experimental results indicate that above the spatial Nyquist frequency,our proposed method can perform well compared to a conventional methods. Moreover, the proposed method can even reduce the number of reference microphones while achieving better noise attenuation.",

    "paper-abstract": "CubeSats are miniature satellites used to carry experimental payloads into orbit, where it is often critical to precisely control their spatial orientation. One way to do this is through the use of magnetorquers, which can be integrated into PCBs. This technique saves considerable space and capital when compared with more common torque-rod magnetorquer systems. Here we derive a method of analyzing different PCB-integrated magnetorquer geometries, parametrizing them such that the moment and efficiency are maximized. Furthermore, by modulating the trace width, the trace number, and other electrical characteristics of the magnetorquer coil, this paper optimizes the generated magnetic moment. Both constant voltage and constant current sources are analyzed as inputs. These optimizations are then simulated in COMSOL for multiple geometries, and it is found that there exists an optimal geometry, given a specified power dissipation. Simulations verify the general trend and maxima of these derivations, barring small, consistent re-scaling in the magnitude of the coil resistance. It is also found that these PCB-magnetorquers provide a sufficient alternative to commercial coil magnetorquers - particularly in volume-restricted configurations. Optimizations for common PCB-implementable geometries on small satellites are tabulated in the Appendix.",

    "paper-abstract": "This paper introduces the model, numerical methods, algorithms and parallel implementation of a thermal reservoir simulator that designed for numerical simulations of thermal reservoir with multiple components in three dimensional domain using distributed-memory parallel computers. Its full mathematical model is introduced with correlations for important properties and well modeling. Various well constraints, such as fixed bottom hole pressure, fixed oil, water, gas and liquid rates, constant heat transfer model, convective heat transfer model, heater model (temperature control, rate control, dual rate/temperature control), and subcool (steam trap), are introduced in details, including their mathematical models and methods. Efficient numerical methods and parallel computing technologies are presented. The simulator is designed for giant models with billions or even trillions of grid blocks using hundreds of thousands of CPUs. Numerical experiments show that our results match commercial simulators, which confirms the correctness of our methods and implementations. SAGD simulation with 15106 well pairs is also presented to study the effectiveness of our numerical methods. Scalability testings demonstrate that our simulator can handle giant models with over 200 billion grid blocks using 100,800 CPU cores and the simulator has good scalability.",

Using surfaces that represent geological boundaries, the objectives are to identify areas where refinement is needed, increase spatial resolution to minimize surface approximation error, reduce redundancy to increase the compactness of the model and identify the geological domain on a block-by-block basis. These objectives are fulfilled by four system components which perform block-surface overlap detection, spatial structure decomposition, sub-blocks consolidation and block tagging, respectively. The main contributions are a coordinate-ascent merging algorithm and a flexible architecture for updating the spatial structure of a block model when given multiple surfaces, which emphasizes the ability to selectively retain or modify previously assigned block labels. The techniques employed include block-surface intersection analysis based on the separable axis theorem and ray-tracing for establishing the location of blocks relative to surfaces. To demonstrate the robustness and applicability of the proposed block merging strategy in a more narrow setting, it is used to reduce block fragmentation in an existing model where surfaces are not given and the minimum block size is fixed. To obtain further insight, a systematic comparison with octree subblocking subsequently illustrates the inherent constraints of dyadic hierarchical decomposition and the importance of inter-scale merging. The results show the proposed method produces merged blocks with less extreme aspect ratios and is highly amenable to parallel processing. The overall framework is applicable to orebody modelling given geological boundaries, and 3D segmentation more generally, where there is a need to delineate spatial regions using mesh surfaces within a block model.",

    "paper-abstract": "Batteries are connected in series to meet the voltage requirement in many applications. A voltage equalizer circuit is necessary to ensure that none of the batteries is over-charged or over-discharged. A novel fast soft-switched cell-to-cell voltage equalizer topology is proposed in this work. This topology can transfer charge from multiple over-charged batteries to multiple under-charged batteries simultaneously avoiding any unnecessary charging or discharging of a battery to achieve fast voltage equalization. The proposed circuit topology and modulation method ensure zero voltage switching under all battery conditions. The circuit operation and soft-switching are analyzed and experimentally verified with a four battery voltage equalizer prototype. The prototype is tested with a battery bank and a hybrid ultra-capacitor bank, and a high conversion efficiency is verified.",

Aligned to this direction, this work puts forth a comprehensive toolbox of optimization models leveraging the control capabilities of smart grid assets. We put forth detailed yet practical models to capture the operation of locally and remotely controlled regulators, and customize the watt-var DER control curves complying with the IEEE 1547.8 mandates. Maintaining radiality is a key requirement germane to various feeder optimization tasks. This requirement is accomplished here through an intuitive and provably correct formulation. The developed toolbox is put into action to reconfigure a grid for minimizing losses using real-world data on a benchmark feeder. The results corroborate that optimal topologies vary across the day and coordinating DERs and regulators is critical during periods of steep net load changes.",

    "paper-abstract": "Millimeter wave (mmWave) and massive MIMO systems are intrinsic components of 5G and beyond. These systems rely on using beamforming codebooks for both initial access and data transmission. Current beam codebooks, however, generally consist of a large number of narrow beams that scan all possible directions, even if these directions are never used. This leads to very large training overhead. Further, these codebooks do not normally account for the hardware impairments or the possible non-uniform array geometries, and their calibration is an expensive process. To overcome these limitations, this paper develops an efficient online machine learning framework that learns how to adapt the codebook beam patterns to the specific deployment, surrounding environment, user distribution, and hardware characteristics. This is done by designing a novel complex-valued neural network architecture in which the neuron weights directly model the beamforming weights of the analog phase shifters, accounting for the key hardware constraints such as the constant-modulus and quantized-angles. This model learns the codebook beams through online and self-supervised training avoiding the need for explicit channel state information. This respects the practical situations where the channel is either unavailable, imperfect, or hard to obtain, especially in the presence of hardware impairments. Simulation results highlight the capability of the proposed solution in learning environment and hardware aware beam codebooks, which can significantly reduce the training overhead, enhance the achievable data rates, and improve the robustness against possible hardware impairments.",

To mitigate selfinterference (SI), we assume that the full duplex-base station (BS) uses SI-subtraction or spatial suppression. Analytical and numerical results confirm that the SI-subtraction outperforms the spatial suppression for SIC in a perfect channel estimation case. It is also concluded that the uplink and overall ergodic rates performance of the spatial suppression is respectively better than those of the SI-subtraction in a imperfect channel estimation case under a given system constraint such as uplink/downlink sum rates and the total transmit power at the BS.",

    "paper-abstract": "We consider a cognitive radio network in a multi-channel licensed environment. Secondary user transmits in a channel if the channel is sensed to be vacant. This results in a tradeoff between sensing time and transmission time. When secondary users are energy constrained, energy available for transmission is less if more energy is used in sensing. This gives rise to an energy tradeoff. For multiple primary channels, secondary users must decide appropriate sensing time and transmission power in each channel to maximize average aggregate-bit throughput in each frame duration while ensuring quality-of-service of primary users. Considering time and energy as limited resources, we formulate this problem as a resource allocation problem. Initially a single secondary user scenario is considered and solution is obtained using decomposition and alternating optimization techniques. Later we extend the analysis for the case of multiple secondary users. Simulation results are presented to study effect of channel occupancy, fading and energy availability on performance of proposed method.",

In this work we evaluate empirically this new approach to hierarchical clustering. We compare hierarchical clustering based on the Baire metric with (i) agglomerative hierarchical clustering, in terms of algorithm properties; (ii) generalized ultrametrics, in terms of definition; and (iii) fast clustering through k-means partititioning, in terms of quality of results. For the latter, we carry out an in depth astronomical study. We apply the Baire distance to spectrometric and photometric redshifts from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey using, in this work, about half a million astronomical objects. We want to know how well the (more costly to determine) spectrometric redshifts can predict the (more easily obtained) photometric redshifts, i.e. we seek to regress the spectrometric on the photometric redshifts, and we use clusterwise regression for this.",

Here, we review ML's contributions, both realized and potential, across several areas of systems neuroscience. We describe four primary roles of ML within neuroscience: 1) creating solutions to engineering problems, 2) identifying predictive variables, 3) setting benchmarks for simple models of the brain, and 4) serving itself as a model for the brain. The breadth and ease of its applicability suggests that machine learning should be in the toolbox of most systems neuroscientists.",

Conventional sensors such as optical microscopes and fluorometers often require complex sample preparation, are restricted to small sample volumes, and are unable to simultaneously capture all pertinent details of a sample such as particle size, shape, concentration, and three dimensional motion. In this article we propose a novel and cost-effective robotic system for mobile microscopic analysis of particles in situ at various depths which are fully controlled by the robot system itself. A miniature underwater digital in-line holographic microscope (DIHM) performs high resolution imaging of microparticles (e.g., algae cells, plastic debris, sediments) while movement allows measurement of particle distributions covering a large area of water. The main contribution of this work is the creation of a low-cost, comprehensive, and small underwater robotic holographic microscope that can assist in a variety of tasks in environmental monitoring and overall assessment of water quality such as contaminant detection and localization. The resulting system provides some unique capabilities such as expanded and systematic coverage of large bodies of water at a low cost. Several challenges such as the trade-off between image quality and cost are addressed to satisfy the aforementioned goals.",

    "paper-abstract": "For many years, multi-object tracking benchmarks have focused on a handful of categories. Motivated primarily by surveillance and self-driving applications, these datasets provide tracks for people, vehicles, and animals, ignoring the vast majority of objects in the world. By contrast, in the related field of object detection, the introduction of large-scale, diverse datasets (e.g., COCO) have fostered significant progress in developing highly robust solutions. To bridge this gap, we introduce a similarly diverse dataset for Tracking Any Object (TAO). It consists of 2,907 high resolution videos, captured in diverse environments, which are half a minute long on average. Importantly, we adopt a bottom-up approach for discovering a large vocabulary of 833 categories, an order of magnitude more than prior tracking benchmarks. To this end, we ask annotators to label objects that move at any point in the video, and give names to them post factum. Our vocabulary is both significantly larger and qualitatively different from existing tracking datasets. To ensure scalability of annotation, we employ a federated approach that focuses manual effort on labeling tracks for those relevant objects in a video (e.g., those that move). We perform an extensive evaluation of state-of-the-art trackers and make a number of important discoveries regarding large-vocabulary tracking in an open-world. In particular, we show that existing single- and multi-object trackers struggle when applied to this scenario in the wild, and that detection-based, multi-object trackers are in fact competitive with user-initialized ones. We hope that our dataset and analysis will boost further progress in the tracking community.",

It must have the property of high efficiency, low cost, and support quality of service (QoS). We present a novel media access control (MAC) protocol that maximizes network efficiency by using dynamic bandwidth allocation (DBA) algorithm suitable for E-PON. This protocol minimizes packet delay and delay variation for high priority traffic to ensure QoS. Simulation results show excellent network throughput. Simulation results also show low packet delay and packet delay variation for high priority traffic compare with traditional MAC protocol of E-PON. When the network performs ranging, this protocol ensures zero interruption of high priority traffic, such as audio or video applications.",

    "paper-abstract": "Decomposing a matrix A into a lower matrix L and an upper matrix U, which is also known as LU decomposition, is an important operation in numerical linear algebra. For a sparse matrix, LU decomposition often introduces more nonzero entries in the L and U factors than the original matrix. Symbolic factorization step is needed to identify the nonzero structures of L and U matrices. Attracted by the enormous potentials of Graphics Processing Units (GPUs), an array of efforts has surged to deploy various steps of LU factorization on GPUs except, to the best of our knowledge, symbolic factorization.This paper introduces GSoFa, a GPU based Symbolic factorization design with the following three optimizations to enable scalable LU symbolic factorization for nonsymmetric pattern sparse matrices on GPUs. First, we introduce a novel fine-grained parallel symbolic factorization algorithm that is well suited for the Single Instruction Multiple Thread (SIMT) architecture of GPUs. Second, we propose multi-source concurrent symbolic factorization to improve the utilization of GPUs with focus on balancing the workload. Third, we introduce a three-pronged optimization to reduce the excessive space requirement faced by multi-source concurrent symbolic factorization. Taken together, this work scales LU symbolic factorization towards 1,000 GPUs with superior performance over the state-of-the-art CPU algorithm.",

Our UFDN specific algorithms perform comparably to random forest methods. The UFDN allows for continuous, partial interpolation between distinct cancer types. Furthermore, we perform an analysis of differentially expressed genes between skin cutaneous melanoma(SKCM) samples and the same samples interpolated into glioblastoma (GBM). We demonstrate that our interpolations learn relevant metagenes that recapitulate known glioblastoma mechanisms and suggest possible starting points for investigations into the metastasis of SKCM into GBM.",

As the number of users increases, the random access in contemporary networks will be flooded by user collisions. In this paper, we propose a reengineered random access protocol, coined strongest-user collision resolution (SUCR). It exploits the channel hardening feature of Massive MIMO channels to enable each user to detect collisions, determine how strong the contenders' channels are, and only keep transmitting if it has the strongest channel gain. The proposed SUCR protocol can quickly and distributively resolve the vast majority of all pilot collisions.",

    "paper-abstract": "Performance analysis for linear time-invariant (LTI) systems has been closely tied to quadratic Lyapunov functions ever since it was shown that LTI system stability is equivalent to the existence of such a Lyapunov function. Some metrics for LTI systems, however, have resisted treatment via means of quadratic Lyapunov functions. Among these, point-wise-in-time metrics, such as peak norms, are not captured accurately using these techniques, and this shortcoming has prevented the development of tools to analyze system behavior by means other than e.g. time-domain simulations. This work demonstrates how the more general class of homogeneous polynomial Lyapunov functions can be used to approximate point-wise-in-time behavior for LTI systems with greater accuracy, and we extend this to the case of linear time-varying (LTV) systems as well. Our findings rely on the recent observation that the search for homogeneous polynomial Lyapunov functions for LTV systems can be recast as a search for quadratic Lyapunov functions for a related hierarchy of time-varying Lyapunov differential equations; thus, performance guarantees for LTV systems are attainable without heavy computation. Numerous examples are provided to demonstrate the findings of this work.",

We try several algorithms and use the most recent developments in quantum search to reduce the number of entangling gates that are currently considered the main source of errors in quantum computations. Comparing theoretical expectations of an algorithm performance with the actual data, we explore the hardware limits, showing sharp, phase-transition-like degradation of performance on quantum processors. We conclude that it is extremely important to design hardware-aware algorithms and to include any other low level optimizations on NISQ devices.",

The probability structure for our extended Fisher's discriminant is explicitly formulated, and we utilize the smoothness assumptions of functional data as prior probabilities. Existing methods which directly employ the smoothness assumption of functional data can be shown as special cases within this framework given corresponding priors while their estimates of the unknowns are one-step approximations to the proposed MAP estimates. Empirical results on various simulation studies and different real applications show that the proposed method significantly outperforms the other Fisher's discriminant methods for functional data.",

    "paper-abstract": "Distributed Constraint Satisfaction (DCSP) has long been considered an important problem in multi-agent systems research. This is because many real-world problems can be represented as constraint satisfaction and these problems often present themselves in a distributed form. In this article, we present a new complete, distributed algorithm called Asynchronous Partial Overlay (APO) for solving DCSPs that is based on a cooperative mediation process. The primary ideas behind this algorithm are that agents, when acting as a mediator, centralize small, relevant portions of the DCSP, that these centralized subproblems overlap, and that agents increase the size of their subproblems along critical paths within the DCSP as the problem solving unfolds. We present empirical evidence that shows that APO outperforms other known, complete DCSP techniques.",

These are comprised of several disciplines like requirements acquisition, design, coding, testing, etc. that must be continuously improved and individually tailored to suit specific software development project. This paper presents an evaluation approach that enables the enterprises to increase development process net benefits by improving disciplines' quality and increasing developers' satisfaction. Our approach builds on Kano's model of quality. Based on an empirical study of top 1000 enterprises from Slovenia we find that application of software development methodologies in individual development disciplines significantly relates to net benefits of IT projects. The results show that different types of Kano quality are present in individual disciplines. Enterprises should be cautious when altering must-be quality disciplines like testing or deployment as they can significantly disrupt the established routines, cause great dissatisfaction between developers and significantly reduce benefits. On the other hand, changing the attractive quality disciplines like requirements acquisition can notably increase developers' satisfaction and benefits but is less likely to disrupt the established routines.",

    "paper-abstract": "Celiac Disease (CD) is a chronic autoimmune disease that affects the small intestine in genetically predisposed children and adults. Gluten exposure triggers an inflammatory cascade which leads to compromised intestinal barrier function. If this enteropathy is unrecognized, this can lead to anemia, decreased bone density, and, in longstanding cases, intestinal cancer. The prevalence of the disorder is 1% in the United States. An intestinal (duodenal) biopsy is considered the \"gold standard\" for diagnosis. The mild CD might go unnoticed due to non-specific clinical symptoms or mild histologic features. In our current work, we trained a model based on deep residual networks to diagnose CD severity using a histological scoring system called the modified Marsh score. The proposed model was evaluated using an independent set of 120 whole slide images from 15 CD patients and achieved an AUC greater than 0.96 in all classes. These results demonstrate the diagnostic power of the proposed model for CD severity classification using histological images.",

In this model, besides Microturbine units, energy storage is employed to provide spinning reserve services for microgirds; and furthermore, from the perspective of demand side management, a consumer satisfaction indicator is developed to measure the quality of user experience. A two-step solution methodology incorporating multi-objective optimization (MOO) and decision analysis is put forward to address this model. First, a powerful heuristic optimization algorithm, called the {\\theta}-dominance based evolutionary algorithm, is used to find a well-distributed set of Pareto-optimal solutions of the problem. And thereby, the best compromise solutions (BCSs) are identified from the entire solutions with the use of decision analysis by integrating fuzzy C-means clustering and grey relation projection. The simulation results on the modified Oak Ridge National Laboratory Distributed Energy Control and Communication lab microgrid test system demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.",

    "paper-abstract": "In this paper, we consider a novel ambient backscatter multiple-access system, where a receiver (Rx) simultaneously detects the signals transmitted from an active transmitter (Tx) and a backscatter Tag. Specifically, the information-carrying signal sent by the Tx arrives at the Rx through two wireless channels: the direct channel from the Tx to the Rx, and the backscatter channel from the Tx to the Tag and then to the Rx. The received signal from the backscatter channel also carries the Tag's information because of the multiplicative backscatter operation at the Tag. This multiple-access system introduces a new channel model, referred to as multiplicative multiple-access channel (M-MAC). We analyze the achievable rate region of the M-MAC, and prove that its region is strictly larger than that of the conventional time-division multiple-access scheme in many cases, including, e.g., the high SNR regime and the case when the direct channel is much stronger than the backscatter channel. Hence, the multiplicative multiple-access scheme is an attractive technique to improve the throughput for ambient backscatter communication systems. Moreover, we analyze the detection error rates for coherent and noncoherent modulation schemes adopted by the Tx and the Tag, respectively, in both synchronous and asynchronous scenarios, which further bring interesting insights for practical system design.",

    "paper-abstract": "Many organizations have the mission of assessing the quality of broadband access services offered by Internet Service Providers (ISPs). They deploy network probes that periodically perform network measures towards selected Internet services. By analyzing the data collected by the probes it is often possible to gain a reasonable estimate of the bandwidth made available by the ISP. However, it is much more difficult to use such data to explain who is responsible of the fluctuations of other network qualities. This is especially true for latency, that is fundamental for several nowadays network services. On the other hand, there are many publicly accessible BGP routers that collect the history of routing changes and that are good candidates to be used for understanding if latency fluctuations depend on interdomain routing. In this paper we provide a methodology that, given a probe that is located inside the network of an ISP and that executes latency measures and given a set of publicly accessible BGP routers located inside the same ISP, decides which routers are best candidates (if any) for studying the relationship between variations of network performance recorded by the probe and interdomain routing changes. We validate the methodology with experimental studies based on data gathered by the RIPE NCC, an organization that is well-known to be independent and that publishes both BGP data within the Routing Information Service (RIS) and probe measurement data within the Atlas project.",

    "paper-abstract": "With the rich set of embedded sensors installed in smartphones and the large number of mobile users, we witness the emergence of many innovative commercial mobile crowdsensing applications that combine the power of mobile technology with crowdsourcing to deliver time-sensitive and location-dependent information to their customers. Motivated by these real-world applications, we consider the task selection problem for heterogeneous users with different initial locations, movement costs, movement speeds, and reputation levels. Computing the social surplus maximization task allocation turns out to be an NP-hard problem. Hence we focus on the distributed case, and propose an asynchronous and distributed task selection (ADTS) algorithm to help the users plan their task selections on their own. We prove the convergence of the algorithm, and further characterize the computation time for users' updates in the algorithm. Simulation results suggest that the ADTS scheme achieves the highest Jain's fairness index and coverage comparing with several benchmark algorithms, while yielding similar user payoff to a greedy centralized benchmark. Finally, we illustrate how mobile users coordinate under the ADTS scheme based on some practical movement time data derived from Google Maps.",

Simple quantum walks are studied analytically, but for large graph structures with complex topologies, numerical solutions are typically required. For the quantum theorist, the Gremlin graph traversal machine and language can be used for the numerical analysis of quantum walks on such structures. Additionally, for the graph theorist, the adoption of quantum walk principles can transform what are currently side-effect laden traversals into pure, stateless functional flows. This is true even when the constraints of quantum mechanics are not fully respected (e.g. reversible and unitary evolution). In sum, Gremlin allows both types of theorist to leverage each other's constructs for the advancement of their respective disciplines.",

    "paper-abstract": "In the relay based telecommunications with $K$ relays between the source and destination, $K+1$ time or frequency slots are required for a single frame transmission. However, without the relays, only one time or frequency slot is used for a single frame transmission. Therefore, despite the benefits of relaying systems, this type of communications is not efficient from the spectral efficiency viewpoint. One solution to reduce this issue might be the full-duplex (FD) relays. An old technique which is reconsidered recently to improve the spectral efficiency of telecommunication systems. However, FD relays have a certain complexity, so, some similar techniques such as successive relays with nearly the same performance but less complexity is taken into account now. In successive relaying systems, two relays between the source and destination are employed which receive the transmitted frames from the source and relay it to the destination successively. This structure generally acts like an FD relays. In this paper, the effective capacity performance of an amplify and forward (AF) successive relaying systems with power allocation strategy at the relays are studied perfectly. However, while the inter-rely interference (IRI) between two successive relays has to be managed well, the power allocation and the effective capacity is derived under different assumptions about the IRI. In this way, we assume weak or strong, short or long-term constraints on the IRI. Then we extract the optimal transmitted power at the relay to maximize the effective capacity under these constraints.",

The use of stochastic gradient descent algorithms is widespread, but the number of iterations required to approximate optimal arguments can be prohibitive in high dimensional problems. Application of second order methods, on the other hand, is impracticable because computation of objective function Hessian inverses incurs excessive computational cost. BFGS modifies gradient descent by introducing a Hessian approximation matrix computed from finite gradient differences. RES utilizes stochastic gradients in lieu of deterministic gradients for both, the determination of descent directions and the approximation of the objective function's curvature. Since stochastic gradients can be computed at manageable computational cost RES is realizable and retains the convergence rate advantages of its deterministic counterparts. Convergence results show that lower and upper bounds on the Hessian egeinvalues of the sample functions are sufficient to guarantee convergence to optimal arguments. Numerical experiments showcase reductions in convergence time relative to stochastic gradient descent algorithms and non-regularized stochastic versions of BFGS. An application of RES to the implementation of support vector machines is developed.",

Our approach shows promising results when compared to the tagging results of the state-of-the-art unsupervised POS taggers.",

To do so, we formalize the principles for the lactate threshold estimation from empirical data and an iterative methodology that enables experience based learning. This strategy arises as a robust and adaptive approach to solve data analysis problems. We compare the results of the heuristic with the most commonly used protocol by making a first quantitative error analysis to show its reliability. Additionally, we provide a computational algorithm so that this quantitative analysis can be easily performed in other lactate threshold protocols. With this work, we have shown that a heuristic %60 of 'endurance running speed reserve', serves for the same purpose of the most commonly used protocol in recreational runners, but improving its operational limitations of accessibility and consistent use.",

In this paper, the effect of nonlinear distortion occurring in the transmitter power amplifier (PA) and the receiver chain is analyzed, alongside with the dynamic range requirements of analog-to-digital converters (ADCs). This is done with detailed system calculations, which combine the properties of the individual electronics components to jointly model the complete transceiver chain, including self-interference cancellation. They also quantify the decrease in the dynamic range for the signal of interest caused by self-interference at the analog-to-digital interface. Using these system calculations, we provide comprehensive numerical results for typical transceiver parameters. The analytical results are also confirmed with full waveform simulations. We observe that the nonlinear distortion produced by the transmitter PA is a significant issue in a full-duplex transceiver and, when using cheaper and less linear components, also the receiver chain nonlinearities become considerable. It is also shown that, with digitally-intensive self-interference cancellation, the quantization noise of the ADCs is another significant problem.",

Models that attempt to extract insight from this firehose of information must face the torrential covariate shift that is endemic to the Twitter platform. While regularly-retrained algorithms can maintain performance in the face of this shift, fixed model features that fail to represent new trends and tokens can quickly become stale, resulting in performance degradation. To mitigate this problem we employ learned features, or embedding models, that can efficiently represent the most relevant aspects of a data distribution. Sharing these embedding models across teams can also reduce redundancy and multiplicatively increase cross-team modeling productivity. In this paper, we detail the commoditized tools, algorithms and pipelines that we have developed and are developing at Twitter to regularly generate high quality, up-to-date embeddings and share them broadly across the company.",

    "paper-abstract": "Identification of patterns from discrete data time-series for statistical inference, threat detection, social opinion dynamics, brain activity prediction has received recent momentum. In addition to the huge data size, the associated challenges are, for example, (i) missing data to construct a closed time-varying complex network, and (ii) contribution of unknown sources which are not probed. Towards this end, the current work focuses on statistical neuron system model with multi-covariates and unknown inputs. Previous research of neuron activity analysis is mainly limited with effects from the spiking history of target neuron and the interaction with other neurons in the system while ignoring the influence of unknown stimuli. We propose to use unknown unknowns, which describes the effect of unknown stimuli, undetected neuron activities and all other hidden sources of error. The maximum likelihood estimation with the fixed-point iteration method is implemented. The fixed-point iterations converge fast, and the proposed methods can be efficiently parallelized and offer computational advantage especially when the input spiking trains are over long time-horizon. The developed framework provides an intuition into the meaning of having extra degrees-of-freedom in the data to support the need for unknowns. The proposed algorithm is applied to simulated spike trains and on real-world experimental data of mouse somatosensory, mouse retina and cat retina. The model shows a successful increasing of system likelihood with respect to the conditional intensity function, and it also reveals the convergence with iterations. Results suggest that the neural connection model with unknown unknowns can efficiently estimate the statistical properties of the process by increasing the network likelihood.",

    "paper-abstract": "Heterogeneous Face Recognition (HFR) refers to matching cross-domain faces, playing a crucial role in public security. Nevertheless, HFR is confronted with the challenges from large domain discrepancy and insufficient heterogeneous data. In this paper, we formulate HFR as a dual generation problem, and tackle it via a novel Dual Variational Generation (DVG-Face) framework. Specifically, a dual variational generator is elaborately designed to learn the joint distribution of paired heterogeneous images. However, the small-scale paired heterogeneous training data may limit the identity diversity of sampling. With this in mind, we propose to integrate abundant identity information of large-scale VIS images into the joint distribution. Furthermore, a pairwise identity preserving loss is imposed on the generated paired heterogeneous images to ensure their identity consistency. As a consequence, massive new diverse paired heterogeneous images with the same identity can be generated from noises. The identity consistency and diversity properties allow us to employ these generated images to train the HFR network via a contrastive learning mechanism, yielding both domain invariant and discriminative embedding features. Concretely, the generated paired heterogeneous images are regarded as positive pairs, and the images obtained from different samplings are considered as negative pairs. Our method achieves superior performances over state-of-the-art methods on seven databases belonging to five HFR tasks, including NIR-VIS, Sketch-Photo, Profile-Frontal Photo, Thermal-VIS, and ID-Camera. The related code will be released at https://github.com/BradyFU.",

    "paper-abstract": "The QR factorization and the SVD are two fundamental matrix decompositions with applications throughout scientific computing and data analysis. For matrices with many more rows than columns, so-called \"tall-and-skinny matrices,\" there is a numerically stable, efficient, communication-avoiding algorithm for computing the QR factorization. It has been used in traditional high performance computing and grid computing environments. For MapReduce environments, existing methods to compute the QR decomposition use a numerically unstable approach that relies on indirectly computing the Q factor. In the best case, these methods require only two passes over the data. In this paper, we describe how to compute a stable tall-and-skinny QR factorization on a MapReduce architecture in only slightly more than 2 passes over the data. We can compute the SVD with only a small change and no difference in performance. We present a performance comparison between our new direct TSQR method, a standard unstable implementation for MapReduce (Cholesky QR), and the classic stable algorithm implemented for MapReduce (Householder QR). We find that our new stable method has a large performance advantage over the Householder QR method. This holds both in a theoretical performance model as well as in an actual implementation.",

    "paper-abstract": "In this paper, we propose a fast deep learning method for object saliency detection using convolutional neural networks. In our approach, we use a gradient descent method to iteratively modify the input images based on the pixel-wise gradients to reduce a pre-defined cost function, which is defined to measure the class-specific objectness and clamp the class-irrelevant outputs to maintain image background. The pixel-wise gradients can be efficiently computed using the back-propagation algorithm. We further apply SLIC superpixels and LAB color based low level saliency features to smooth and refine the gradients. Our methods are quite computationally efficient, much faster than other deep learning based saliency methods. Experimental results on two benchmark tasks, namely Pascal VOC 2012 and MSRA10k, have shown that our proposed methods can generate high-quality salience maps, at least comparable with many slow and complicated deep learning methods. Comparing with the pure low-level methods, our approach excels in handling many difficult images, which contain complex background, highly-variable salient objects, multiple objects, and/or very small salient objects.",

    "paper-abstract": "This paper tackles the problem of Lipschitz regularization of Convolutional Neural Networks. Lipschitz regularity is now established as a key property of modern deep learning with implications in training stability, generalization, robustness against adversarial examples, etc. However, computing the exact value of the Lipschitz constant of a neural network is known to be NP-hard. Recent attempts from the literature introduce upper bounds to approximate this constant that are either efficient but loose or accurate but computationally expensive. In this work, by leveraging the theory of Toeplitz matrices, we introduce a new upper bound for convolutional layers that is both tight and easy to compute. Based on this result we devise an algorithm to train Lipschitz regularized Convolutional Neural Networks.",

          "The key task of constructing malleable job model is, therefore, to represent the internal parallelism variations of parallel programs over time.",
          "To achieve that, we divide a parallel job generated by a moldable job model into a series of phases and each phase is captured by an internal structure randomly selected from one of the seven generic forms of distinct parallelism variation curves we have identified.",

          "As shown in the Fig. 3, function F1() consists of a fully parallelized FOR loop without interdependency profiling the Step curve; functions F2(), F3() and F4() recursively spawns themselves and other threads with different calling patterns, hence creating various rates of increasing parallelism."

    "paper-abstract": "The proliferation of multi-core and multiprocessor-based computer systems has led to explosive development of parallel applications and hence the need for efficient schedulers. In this paper, we study hierarchical scheduling for malleable parallel jobs on multiprocessor-based systems, which appears in many distributed and multilayered computing environments. We propose a hierarchical scheduling algorithm, named AC-DS, that consists of a feedback-driven adaptive scheduler, a desire aggregation scheme and an efficient resource allocation policy. From theoretical perspective, we show that AC-DS has scalable performance regardless of the number of hierarchical levels. In particular, we prove that AC-DS achieves $O(1)$-competitiveness with respect to the overall completion time of the jobs, or the makespan. A detailed malleable job model is developed to experimentally evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed scheduling algorithm. The results verify the scalability of AC-DS and demonstrate that AC-DS outperforms other strategies for a wide range of parallel workloads.",

          "Moreover, while for Cshort the error is almost never greater than 10% (occurring for only one publication), using C-J the error is very substantial, above all for publications receiving scarce citations over the long period (i.e. with Clong less than 10).",
          "The dataset does not contain any examples of cases opposite to that of Jane, meaning a publications portfolio where C-J provides a better prediction of Clong.",
          "In effect, aggregating all the observations (89,752), 11 we obtain the correlations shown in Table 3, which indicate a level of convergence between Clong and Cshort (Pearson and Spearman correlations equal to 0.497 and 0.484) greater than that between Clong and C-J (0.377 and 0.400).",

          "Subdividing the dataset of publications by year (Table 4), we note (as we would expect) that the levels of convergence of the annual distributions decline with the reduction of the citation window.",
          "However, Cshort always approximates Clong better than C-J.",
          "In the comparison between Cshort and Clong, the Pearson correlation coefficient shifts from 0.543 in 2004 to 0.458 in 2006, while in the comparison between C-J and Clong it drops from 0.481 a 0.273.",

In the national research assessment exercises using metrics the citation window is necessarily short, but in some cases is sufficient to advise the use of simple citations. For the Italian VQR 2011-2014, the choice was instead made to adopt a linear weighted combination of citations and journal metric percentiles, with weights differentiated by discipline and year. Given the strategic importance of the exercise, whose results inform the allocation of a significant share of resources for the national academic system, we examined whether the predictive power of the proposed indicator is stronger than the simple citation count. The results show the opposite, for all discipline in the sciences and a citation window above two years.",

However, the technique of caching at edge can only reduce the backhaul delay, other techniques such as BS densification will also need to be considered to reduce the fronthaul delay. In this work, we study the trade-offs between BS densification and cache size under delay constraint at a typical user (UE). For this, we use the downlink SINR coverage probability and throughput obtained based on stochastic geometrical analysis. The network deployment of BS and cache storage is introduced as a minimization problem of the product of the BS intensity and cache size which we refer to the product of \\tit{cache intensity}' under probabilistic delay constraint. We examine the cases when (i) either BS intensity or the cache size is held fixed, and (ii) when both BS intensity and the cache size are vary. For the case when both BS intensity and the cache size are variable, the problem become nonconvex and we convert into a geometric programing which we solve it analytically.",

    "paper-abstract": "We prove a result which strongly hints at the computational weakness of a model of tile assembly that has so far resisted many attempts of formal analysis or positive constructions. Specifically, we prove that, in Winfree's abstract Tile Assembly Model, when restricted to use only noncooperative bindings, any long enough path starting from the seed that can grow in all terminal assemblies is pumpable, meaning that this path can be extended into an infinite, ultimately periodic path. This result can be seen as a geometric generalization of the pumping lemma of finite state automata, and closes the question of what can be computed deterministically in this model. Moreover, this question has motivated the development of a new method called visible glues. We believe that this method can also be used to tackle other long-standing problems in computational geometry, in relation for instance with self-avoiding paths. Tile assembly (including non-cooperative tile assembly) was originally introduced by Winfree and Rothemund in STOC 2000 to understand how to program shapes. The non-cooperative variant, also known as temperature 1 tile assembly, is the model where tiles are allowed to bind as soon as they match on one side, whereas in cooperative tile assembly, some tiles need to match on several sides in order to bind. Previously, exactly one known result (SODA 2014) showed a restriction on the assemblies general non-cooperative self-assembly could achieve, without any implication on its computational expressiveness. With non-square tiles (like polyominos, SODA 2015), other recent works have shown that the model quickly becomes computationally powerful.",

A number of trusted cooperative half-duplex relay luminaires are deployed to aid with securing the transmitted data. Transmitters are equipped with single light fixtures, containing multiple light emitting diodes, and receiving nodes are equipped with single photo-detectors, rendering the considered setting as a single-input single-output system. Transmission is amplitude-constrained to maintain operation within the light emitting diodes' dynamic range. Achievable secrecy rate regions are derived under such amplitude constraints for this multi-receiver wiretap channel, first for direct transmission without the relays, and then for multiple relaying schemes: cooperative jamming, decode-and-forward, and amplify-and-forward. Superposition coding with uniform signaling is used at the transmitter and the relays. Further, for each relaying scheme, secure beamforming vectors are carefully designed at the relay nodes in order to hurt the eavesdropper and/or benefit the legitimate receivers. Superiority of the proposed relaying schemes, with secure beamforming, is shown over direct transmission. It is also shown that the best relaying scheme depends on how far the eavesdropper is located from the transmitter and the relays, the number of relays, and their geometric layout.",

It utilizes a carefully designed coupling of a partial differential equation (pde) based theory of dislocation mediated crystal plasticity with time-averaged inputs from microscopic Dislocation Dynamics (DD), adapting a state-of-the-art mathematical coarse-graining scheme. The stress-strain response of mesoscopic samples at realistic, slow, loading rates up to appreciable values of strain is obtained, with significant speed-up in compute time compared to conventional DD. Effects of crystal orientation, loading rate, and the ratio of the initial mobile to sessile dislocation density on the macroscopic response, for both load and displacement controlled simulations are demonstrated. These results are obtained without using any phenomenological constitutive assumption, except for thermal activation which is not a part of microscopic DD. The results also demonstrate the effect of the internal stresses on the collective behavior of dislocations, manifesting, in a set of examples, as a Stage I to Stage II hardening transition.",

This is achieved using a mixture model where the mixing coefficients are modeled by a Dirichlet process, allowing us to integrate over the coefficients when performing inference. Critically, this then allows us to automatically vary the number of autoencoders in the mixture based on the data. Experiments show the flexibility of our method, particularly for semi-supervised learning, where only a small number of training samples are available.",

    "paper-abstract": "In this paper, we study the degrees of freedom (DoF) of the symmetric multi-relay multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) Y channel, where three user nodes, each with M antennas, communicate via K geographically separated relay nodes, each with N antennas. For this model, we establish a general DoF achievability framework based on linear precoding and post-processing methods. The framework poses a nonlinear problem with respect to user precoders and post-processors, as well as relay precoders. To solve this problem, we adopt an uplink-downlink asymmetric strategy, where the user precoders are designed for signal alignment and the user post-processors are used for interference neutralization. With the user precoder and post-processor designs fixed as such, the original problem then reduces to a problem of relay precoder design. To address the solvability of the system, we propose a general method for solving matrix equations. This method is also useful to the DoF analysis of many other multiway relay networks. Together with the techniques of antenna disablement and symbol extension, an achievable DoF of the symmetric multi-relay MIMO Y channel is derived for an arbitrary setup of (K, M, N). We show that, for K >= 2, the optimal DoF is achieved for M/N in [0, max{sqrt(3K)/3,1}) and [(3K+sqrt(9K^2-12K))/6,infinity). We also show that the uplink-downlink asymmetric design proposed in this paper considerably outperforms the conventional approach based on uplink-downlink symmetry.",

DIP networks have been recently introduced for applications in image processing; also first experimental results for applying DIP to inverse problems have been reported. This paper aims at discussing different interpretations of DIP and to obtain analytic results for specific network designs and linear operators. The main contribution is to introduce the idea of viewing these approaches as the optimization of Tikhonov functionals rather than optimizing networks. Besides theoretical results, we present numerical verifications.",

          "As we showed in earlier work (van Raan 2008a) the average number of citations correlates very strongly with the average field-citation density of a university.",
          "In other words, if a university is characterized by strong research activities in fields with the high citation density, and these are predominantly the (bio)medical and the basic natural science fields, then its MCS will be relatively high.",
          "In contrast, technical universities focus on engineering and applied research, in these fields the citation density is considerably lower as compared to the medical fields, and thus the average number of citation paper for these universities will be lower.",

    "paper-abstract": "Recent studies of urban scaling show that important socioeconomic city characteristics such as wealth and innovation capacity exhibit a nonlinear, particularly a power law scaling with population size. These nonlinear effects are common to all cities, with similar power law exponents. These findings mean that the larger the city, the more disproportionally they are places of wealth and innovation. Local properties of cities cause a deviation from the expected behavior as predicted by the power law scaling. In this paper we demonstrate that universities show a similar behavior as cities in the distribution of the gross university income in terms of total number of citations over size in terms of total number of publications. Moreover, the power law exponents for university scaling are comparable to those for urban scaling. We find that deviations from the expected behavior can indeed be explained by specific local properties of universities, particularly the field-specific composition of a university, and its quality in terms of field-normalized citation impact. By studying both the set of the 500 largest universities worldwide and a specific subset of these 500 universities -- the top-100 European universities -- we are also able to distinguish between properties of universities with as well as without selection of one specific local property, the quality of a university in terms of its average field-normalized citation impact. It also reveals an interesting observation concerning the working of a crucial property in networked systems, preferential attachment.",

    "paper-abstract": "This paper studies a multi-hop decode-and-forward (DF) simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) system where a source sends data to a destination with the aid of multi-hop relays which do not depend on an external energy source. To this end, we apply power splitting (PS) based SWIPT relaying protocol so that the relays can harvest energy from the received signals from the previous hop to reliably forward the information of the source to the destination. We aim to solve two optimization problems relevant to our system model. First, we minimize the transmit power at the source under the individual quality-of-service (QoS) threshold constraints of the relays and the destination nodes by optimizing PS ratios at the relays. The second is to maximize the minimum system achievable rate by optimizing the PS ratio at each relay. Based on convex optimization techniques, the globally optimal PS ratio solution is obtained in closed-form for both problems. By setting the QoS threshold constraint the same for each node for the source transmit power problem, we discovered that either the minimum source transmit power or the maximum system throughput can be found using the same approach. Numerical results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed optimal SWIPT PS design over conventional fixed PS ratio schemes.",

    "paper-abstract": "In this work, we propose a joint audio-video fingerprint Automatic Content Recognition (ACR) technology for media retrieval. The problem is focused on how to balance the query accuracy and the size of fingerprint, and how to allocate the bits of the fingerprint to video frames and audio frames to achieve the best query accuracy. By constructing a novel concept called Coverage, which is highly correlated to the query accuracy, we are able to form a rate-coverage model to translate the original problem into an optimization problem that can be resolved by dynamic programming. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that uses joint audio-video fingerprint ACR technology for media retrieval with a theoretical problem formulation. Experimental results indicate that compared to reference algorithms, the proposed method has up to 25% query accuracy improvement while using 60% overall bit-rates, and 25% bit-rate reduction while achieving 85% accuracy, and it significantly outperforms the solution with single audio or video source fingerprint.",

    "paper-abstract": "Radio frequency (RF) energy harvesting is key in attaining perpetual lifetime for time-critical wireless powered communication networks due to full control on energy transfer, far field region, small and low-cost circuitry. In this paper, we propose a novel minimum length scheduling problem to determine the optimal power control, time allocation and transmission schedule subject to data, energy causality and maximum transmit power constraints in a full-duplex wireless powered communication network. We first formulate the problem as a mixed integer non-linear programming problem and conjecture that the problem is NP-hard. As a solution strategy, we demonstrate that the power control and time allocation, and scheduling problems can be solved separately in the optimal solution. For the power control and time allocation problem, we derive the optimal solution by using Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions. For the scheduling, we introduce a penalty function allowing reformulation as a sum penalty minimization problem. Upon derivation of the optimality conditions based on the characteristics of the penalty function, we propose two polynomial-time heuristic algorithms and a reduced-complexity exact algorithm employing smart pruning techniques. Via extensive simulations, we illustrate that the proposed heuristic schemes outperform the previously proposed schemes for predetermined transmission order of users and achieve close-to-optimal solutions.",

    "paper-abstract": "Device-to-device (D2D) communication, which enables a direct connection between users while bypassing the cellular channels to base stations (BSs), is a promising way to offload the traffic from conventional cellular networks. In D2D communication, one recurring problem is that, in order to optimally allocate resources across D2D and cellular users, the knowledge of D2D channel gains is needed. However, such knowledge is hard to obtain at reasonable signaling costs. In this paper, we show this problem can be circumvented by tapping into the information provided by the estimation of the cellular channels between the users and surrounding BSs as this estimation is done anyway for a normal operation of the network. While the cellular and D2D channel gains exhibit independent fast fading behavior, we show that average gains of the cellular and D2D channels share a non-explicit correlation structure, which is rooted into the network topology, terrain, and buildings setup. We propose a machine (deep) learning approach capable of predicting the D2D channel gains from seemingly independent cellular channels. Our results show a high degree of convergence between true and predicted D2D channel gains. The predicted gains allow to reach a near-optimal communication capacity in many radio resource management algorithms.",

    "paper-abstract": "Digital revolution and recent advances in telecommunications technology enable to design communication systems which operate within the regions close to the theoretical capacity limits. Ever-increasing demand for wireless communications and emerging numerous high-capacity services, data rates and applications mandate providers to employ more bandwidth-oriented solutions to meet the requirements. It is clear that such rates could only be achieved by employing more bandwidth with the state-of-the- art technology. Considering the fact that bands in the range of 275GHz-3000GHz, which are known as Terahertz (THz) bands, are not allocated yet for specific active services around the globe, there is an enormous potential to achieve the desired data rates. Although THz bands look promising to achieve data rates on the order of several tens of Gbps, realization of fully operational THz communications systems obliges to carry out a multi- disciplinary effort including statistical propagation and channel characterizations, adaptive transceiver designs, reconfigurable platforms, advanced signal processing algorithms and techniques along with upper layer protocols equipped with various security and privacy levels. Therefore, in this study, several important statistical parameters for line-of-sight (LOS) channels are measured. High resolution frequency domain measurements are carried out at single-sweep within a span of 60GHz. Impact of antenna misalignment under LOS conditions is also investigated. By validating exponential decay of the received power in both time and frequency domain, path loss exponent is examined for different frequencies along with the frequency-dependent path loss phenomenon. Furthermore, impact of humidity is also tested under LOS scenario. Measurement results are presented along with relevant discussions and future directions are provided as well.",

We survey the recent advances and transformative potential of machine learning (ML), including deep learning, in the field of acoustics. ML is a broad family of techniques, which are often based in statistics, for automatically detecting and utilizing patterns in data. Relative to conventional acoustics and signal processing, ML is data-driven. Given sufficient training data, ML can discover complex relationships between features and desired labels or actions, or between features themselves. With large volumes of training data, ML can discover models describing complex acoustic phenomena such as human speech and reverberation. ML in acoustics is rapidly developing with compelling results and significant future promise. We first introduce ML, then highlight ML developments in four acoustics research areas: source localization in speech processing, source localization in ocean acoustics, bioacoustics, and environmental sounds in everyday scenes.",

    "paper-abstract": "The future of mobile communications looks exciting with the potential new use cases and challenging requirements of future 6th generation (6G) and beyond wireless networks. Since the beginning of the modern era of wireless communications, the propagation medium has been perceived as a randomly behaving entity between the transmitter and the receiver, which degrades the quality of the received signal due to the uncontrollable interactions of the transmitted radio waves with the surrounding objects. The recent advent of reconfigurable intelligent surfaces in wireless communications enables, on the other hand, network operators to control the scattering, reflection, and refraction characteristics of the radio waves, by overcoming the negative effects of natural wireless propagation. Recent results have revealed that reconfigurable intelligent surfaces can effectively control the wavefront, e.g., the phase, amplitude, frequency, and even polarization, of the impinging signals without the need of complex decoding, encoding, and radio frequency processing operations. Motivated by the potential of this emerging technology, the present article is aimed to provide the readers with a detailed overview and historical perspective on state-of-the-art solutions, and to elaborate on the fundamental differences with other technologies, the most important open research issues to tackle, and the reasons why the use of reconfigurable intelligent surfaces necessitates to rethink the communication-theoretic models currently employed in wireless networks. This article also explores theoretical performance limits of reconfigurable intelligent surface-assisted communication systems using mathematical techniques and elaborates on the potential use cases of intelligent surfaces in 6G and beyond wireless networks.",

    "paper-abstract": "The problem of generalized function matching can be defined as follows: given a pattern $p=p_1 \\cdots p_m$ and a text $t=t_1 \\cdots t_n$, find a mapping $f:\\Sigma_p\\rightarrow\\Sigma_t^{*}$ and all text locations $i$ such that $f(p_1) f(p_2) \\cdots f(p_m) = t_i \\cdots t_j$, a substring of $t$. By modifying the restrictions of the matching function $f$, one can obtain different matching problems, many of which have important applications. When $f:\\Sigma_p\\rightarrow\\Sigma_t$ we are faced with problems found in the well-established field of combinatorial pattern matching. If the single character constraint is lifted and $f:\\Sigma_p\\rightarrow\\Sigma_t^{*}$, we obtain generalized function matching as introduced by Amir and Nor (JDA 2007). If we further constrain $f$ to be injective, then we arrive at generalized parametrized matching as defined by Clifford et al. (SPIRE 2009). There are a number of important applications for pattern matching in computational biology, text editors and data compression, to name a few. Therefore, many efficient algorithms have been developed for a wide variety of specific problems including finding tandem repeats in DNA sequences, optimizing embedded systems by reusing code etc. In this work we present a heuristic algorithm illustrating a practical approach to tackling a variant of generalized function matching where $f:\\Sigma_p\\rightarrow\\Sigma_t^{+}$ and demonstrate its performance on human-produced text as well as random strings.",

Because of a highly discrete character of the process, the analysis cannot use the continous approximation, widely exploited for most of the models. Using discrete approach we investigate the epidemic threshold and the quasi-stationary distribution. The main result is a theorem about mixing time for the process, which scales like logarithm of the network size and which is proportional to the inverse of the distance from the epidemic threshold. In order to present the model in the full context, we review modern approach to epidemic spreading modeling based on complex networks and present necessary information about random networks, discrete-time Markov chains and their quasi-stationary distributions.",

    "paper-abstract": "This paper demonstrates that multilingual denoising pre-training produces significant performance gains across a wide variety of machine translation (MT) tasks. We present mBART -- a sequence-to-sequence denoising auto-encoder pre-trained on large-scale monolingual corpora in many languages using the BART objective. mBART is one of the first methods for pre-training a complete sequence-to-sequence model by denoising full texts in multiple languages, while previous approaches have focused only on the encoder, decoder, or reconstructing parts of the text. Pre-training a complete model allows it to be directly fine tuned for supervised (both sentence-level and document-level) and unsupervised machine translation, with no task-specific modifications. We demonstrate that adding mBART initialization produces performance gains in all but the highest-resource settings, including up to 12 BLEU points for low resource MT and over 5 BLEU points for many document-level and unsupervised models. We also show it also enables new types of transfer to language pairs with no bi-text or that were not in the pre-training corpus, and present extensive analysis of which factors contribute the most to effective pre-training.",

Many research efforts have been conducted to facilitate the presentation modes used by instructors in classrooms as well as provide means for students to review lectures through web browsers. Other studies have been made to provide acoustical design recommendations for classrooms like room size and reverberation times. However, using acoustical features of classrooms as a way to provide education systems with feedback about the learning process was not thoroughly investigated in any of these studies. We propose a system that extracts different sound features of students and instructors, and then uses machine learning techniques to evaluate the acoustical quality of any learning environment. We infer conclusions about the students' satisfaction with the quality of lectures. Using classifiers instead of surveys and other subjective ways of measures can facilitate and speed such experiments which enables us to perform them continuously. We believe our system enables education systems to continuously review and improve their teaching strategies and acoustical quality of classrooms.",

Failure of any of the mechanical and digital devices that we rely on can be extremely disruptive. At times, the presence of an expert is needed to analyze, troubleshoot, and fix the problem. The increased demand and rapidly evolving mechanisms have led to an insufficient amount of skilled workers, thus resulting in long waiting times for consumers, and correspondingly high prices for expert services. We assert that performing a repair task with the guidance of experts from any geographical location provides an appropriate solution to the growing demand for handyman skills. This paper proposes an innovative mechanism for two geographically separated people to collaborate on a physical task. It also offers novel methods to analyze the efficiency of a collaboration system and a collaboration protocol through complexity indices. Using the innovative Collaborative Appliance for Remote-help (CARE) and with the support of a remote expert, fifty-nine subjects with minimal or no prior mechanical knowledge were able to elevate a car for replacing a tire; in a second experiment, thirty subjects with minimal or no prior plumbing knowledge were able to change the cartridge of a faucet. In both cases, average times were close to standard average repair times, and more importantly, both tasks were completed with total accuracy. Our experiments and results show that one can use the developed mechanism and methods for expanding the protocols for a variety of home, vehicle, and appliance repairs and installations.",

    "paper-abstract": "The problem of quality of service (QoS) and jamming-aware communications is considered in an adversarial wireless network subject to external eavesdropping and jamming attacks. To ensure robust communication against jamming, an interference-aware routing protocol is developed that allows nodes to avoid communication holes created by jamming attacks. Then, a distributed cooperation framework, based on deep reinforcement learning, is proposed that allows nodes to assess network conditions and make deep learning-driven, distributed, and real-time decisions on whether to participate in data communications, defend the network against jamming and eavesdropping attacks, or jam other transmissions. The objective is to maximize the network performance that incorporates throughput, energy efficiency, delay, and security metrics. Simulation results show that the proposed jamming-aware routing approach is robust against jamming and when throughput is prioritized, the proposed deep reinforcement learning approach can achieve significant (measured as three-fold) increase in throughput, compared to a benchmark policy with fixed roles assigned to nodes.",

    "paper-abstract": "In traditional compressed sensing theory, the dictionary matrix is given a priori, whereas in real applications this matrix suffers from random noise and fluctuations. In this paper we consider a signal model where each column in the dictionary matrix is affected by a structured noise. This formulation is common in direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation of off-grid targets, encountered in both radar systems and array processing. We propose to use joint sparse signal recovery to solve the compressed sensing problem with structured dictionary mismatches and also give an analytical performance bound on this joint sparse recovery. We show that, under mild conditions, the reconstruction error of the original sparse signal is bounded by both the sparsity and the noise level in the measurement model. Moreover, we implement fast first-order algorithms to speed up the computing process. Numerical examples demonstrate the good performance of the proposed algorithm, and also show that the joint-sparse recovery method yields a better reconstruction result than existing methods. By implementing the joint sparse recovery method, the accuracy and efficiency of DOA estimation are improved in both passive and active sensing cases.",

    "paper-abstract": "A problem deeply investigated by multimedia forensics researchers is the one of detecting which device has been used to capture a video. This enables to trace down the owner of a video sequence, which proves extremely helpful to solve copyright infringement cases as well as to fight distribution of illicit material (e.g., underage clips, terroristic threats, etc.). Currently, the most promising methods to tackle this task exploit unique noise traces left by camera sensors on acquired images. However, given the recent advancements in motion stabilization of video content, robustness of sensor pattern noise-based techniques are strongly hindered. Indeed, video stabilization introduces geometric transformations between video frames, thus making camera fingerprint estimation problematic with classical approaches. In this paper, we deal with the challenging problem of attributing stabilized videos to their recording device. Specifically, we propose: (i) a strategy to extract the characteristic fingerprint of a device, starting from either a set of images or stabilized video sequences; (ii) a strategy to match a stabilized video sequence with a given fingerprint in order to solve the device attribution problem. The proposed methodology is tested on videos coming from a set of different smartphones, taken from the modern publicly available Vision Dataset. The conducted experiments also provide an interesting insight on the effect of modern smartphones video stabilization algorithms on specific video frames.",

However, it tends to sacrifice clean accuracy heavily in favor of robustness, and with a large perturbation, it can cause models to learn a trivial solution, always predicting the same class. To address the above concerns, we propose Adversarial Training with Early Stopping (ATES), guided by principles from curriculum learning that emphasizes on starting \"easy\" and gradually ramping up on the \"difficulty\" of training. ATES is derived from our formulation for curriculum learning in the adversarial setting which introduces an additional curriculum constraint to the normal adversarial loss. To satisfy this constraint, we apply early stopping on the adversarial example generation step when a specified level of difficulty is reached. ATES stabilizes network training even for a large perturbation norm and allows the network to operate at a better clean accuracy versus robustness trade-off curve compared to AT. This leads to a significant improvement in both clean accuracy and robustness compared to AT, TRADES, and the other baselines.",

    "paper-abstract": "Distance/Similarity learning is a fundamental problem in machine learning. For example, kNN classifier or clustering methods are based on a distance/similarity measure. Metric learning algorithms enhance the efficiency of these methods by learning an optimal distance function from data. Most metric learning methods need training information in the form of pair or triplet sets. Nowadays, this training information often is obtained from the Internet via crowdsourcing methods. Therefore, this information may contain label noise or outliers leading to the poor performance of the learned metric. It is even possible that the learned metric functions perform worse than the general metrics such as Euclidean distance. To address this challenge, this paper presents a new robust metric learning method based on the Rescaled Hinge loss. This loss function is a general case of the popular Hinge loss and initially introduced in (Xu et al. 2017) to develop a new robust SVM algorithm. In this paper, we formulate the metric learning problem using the Rescaled Hinge loss function and then develop an efficient algorithm based on HQ (Half-Quadratic) to solve the problem. Experimental results on a variety of both real and synthetic datasets confirm that our new robust algorithm considerably outperforms state-of-the-art metric learning methods in the presence of label noise and outliers.",

This non-informative scoring criterion assigns same score for network structures that encode same independence statements. However, before applying the BDeu score, one must determine a single parameter, the equivalent sample size alpha. Unfortunately no generally accepted rule for determining the alpha parameter has been suggested. This is disturbing, since in this paper we show through a series of concrete experiments that the solution of the network structure optimization problem is highly sensitive to the chosen alpha parameter value. Based on these results, we are able to give explanations for how and why this phenomenon happens, and discuss ideas for solving this problem.",

In this paper we develop a correlated resource model of Internet end hosts based on real trace data taken from the SETI@home project. This data covers a 5-year period with statistics for 2.7 million hosts. The resource model is based on statistical analysis of host computational power, memory, and storage as well as how these resources change over time and the correlations between them. We find that resources with few discrete values (core count, memory) are well modeled by exponential laws governing the change of relative resource quantities over time. Resources with a continuous range of values are well modeled with either correlated normal distributions (processor speed for integer operations and floating point operations) or log-normal distributions (available disk space). We validate and show the utility of the models by applying them to a resource allocation problem for Internet-distributed applications, and demonstrate their value over other models. We also make our trace data and tool for automatically generating realistic Internet end hosts publicly available.",

Inspired by variational methods for image restoration relying on partial differential equations, we choose to benchmark several forms of Neural DEs and backpropagation methods on single image super-resolution. The adjoint method previously proposed for gradient estimation has no theoretical stability guarantees; we find a practical case where this makes it unusable, and show that discrete sensitivity analysis has better stability. In our experiments, differential models match the performance of a state-of-the art super-resolution model.",

Given a collection of coloured balls, the task is to identify the majority colour or state that no such colour exists. Whilst the special case of two-colours has been well studied, the average-case performance for arbitrarily many colours has not. In this paper, we present heuristic analysis of the average-case performance of three deterministic algorithms that appear in the literature. We empirically validate our analysis with large scale simulations.",

    "paper-abstract": "Neural networks have recently had a lot of success for many tasks. However, neural network architectures that perform well are still typically designed manually by experts in a cumbersome trial-and-error process. We propose a new method to automatically search for well-performing CNN architectures based on a simple hill climbing procedure whose operators apply network morphisms, followed by short optimization runs by cosine annealing. Surprisingly, this simple method yields competitive results, despite only requiring resources in the same order of magnitude as training a single network. E.g., on CIFAR-10, our method designs and trains networks with an error rate below 6% in only 12 hours on a single GPU; training for one day reduces this error further, to almost 5%.",

          "It can be observed that the MD method with user grouping always outperforms the ZF  method.",
          "Specifically for the case of M = N = 10, the SNR gain is approximately 20dB at BER 10 \u22124 .",
          "We find that the closer the number of users N is to the number of transmitters M , the larger the performance gap between the proposed MD strategy and ZF method becomes, since when M is close to N , there is a higher probability that the Hermitian angle between the channel vector of two users is small and as a consequence, the grouping gain becomes large.",

          "In addition, it is not surprising that the BER performance becomes worse when the channel links from the BS becomes more correlated.",
          "Similar observations are also verified for the case with M = 20 and N = 18, as shown in Fig. 8.",
          "The last kind of simulation is to compare our proposed MD method with other existing precoding methods in Figs. 9 and 10.",
          "Toward this end, in Fig. 9, we compare the average BER of the MD approach with SLNR based scheme in [28] and MMSE method with equal power allocation as well as TD and ZF methods when M = 4, N = 4.",
          "For the MD method, we consider both the proposed suboptimal grouping method described in Algorithm 3 and an exhaustive search grouping scheme that enumerates all the possible grouping methods for seeking the best possible max-min weighted SNR in Problem 2.",
          "It can be observed that the TD method has the worst BER in low and moderate SNR regimes.",
          "It can also be noticed that the SLNR and MMSE methods with equal power allocation have the same BER performance as proved by [75] and both of them outperform the ZF method.",
          "In addition, we can see that in a low SNR regime, the MMSE and SLNR methods have a lower BER than the MD method.",
          "However, in a moderate and high SNR regime, the MD method outperforms all the other methods in terms of BER.",
          "Despite the fact that it has better error performance than the proposed MD approach with the suboptimal grouping method, the exhaustive grouping MD method obtains the marginal BER gain and costs much higher computational complexity.",

    "paper-abstract": "This paper considers a discrete-time multiuser multiple-input single-output (MISO) Gaussian broadcast channel~(BC), in which channel state information (CSI) is available at both the transmitter and the receivers. The flexible and explicit design of a uniquely decomposable constellation group (UDCG) is provided based on pulse amplitude modulation (PAM) and rectangular quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) constellations. With this, a modulation division (MD) transmission scheme is developed for the MISO BC. The proposed MD scheme enables each receiver to uniquely and efficiently detect their desired signals from the superposition of mutually interfering cochannel signals in the absence of noise. In our design, the optimal transmitter beamforming problem is solved in a closed-form for two-user MISO BC using max-min fairness as a design criterion. Then, for a general case with more than two receivers, we develop a user-grouping-based beamforming scheme, where the grouping method, beamforming vector design and power allocation problems are addressed by using weighted max-min fairness. It is shown that our proposed approach has a lower probability of error compared with the zero-forcing (ZF) method when the Hermitian angle between the two channel vectors is small in a two-user case. In addition, simulation results also reveal that for the general channel model with more than two users, our user-grouping-based scheme significantly outperforms the ZF, time division (TD), minimum mean-square error (MMSE) and signal-to-leakage-and-noise ratio (SLNR) based techniques in moderate and high SNR regimes when the number of users approaches to the number of base station (BS) antennas and it degrades into the ZF scheme when the number of users is far less than the number of BS antennas in Rayleigh fading channels.",

    "paper-abstract": "During and after disasters, highways provide vital routes for emergency services, relief efforts, and evacuation activities. Thus, a timely and reliable assessment of disaster impacts on highways is critical for decision-makers to quickly and effectively perform relief and recovery efforts. Recently, social media has increasingly been used in disaster management for obtaining a rapid, public-centric assessment of disaster impacts due to its near real-time, social and informational characteristics. Although promising, the employment of social media for assessing disaster impacts on highways is still limited due to the inability of extracting accurate highway-related data from social media. To overcome this limitation, a systematic approach is proposed to identify highway-related data from social media for assessing disaster impacts on highways, and a case study of Hurricane Harvey in Houston, TX is employed for the demonstration. The approach is constructed through three steps: (1) building data sources for social media and highways of interest in Houston, respectively; (2) adapting the social media data to each highway through a developed mapping algorithm; (3) assessing disaster impacts through analyzing social media activities in terms of their intensity, geographic, and topic distributions. Results show that the proposed approach is capable of capturing the temporal patterns of disaster impacts on highways. Official news and reports are employed to validate the assessed impacts.",

    "paper-abstract": "We present a novel dynamic configuration technique for deep neural networks that permits step-wise energy-accuracy trade-offs during runtime. Our configuration technique adjusts the number of channels in the network dynamically depending on response time, power, and accuracy targets. To enable this dynamic configuration technique, we co-design a new training algorithm, where the network is incrementally trained such that the weights in channels trained in earlier steps are fixed. Our technique provides the flexibility of multiple networks while storing and utilizing one set of weights. We evaluate our techniques using both an ASIC-based hardware accelerator as well as a low-power embedded GPGPU and show that our approach leads to only a small or negligible loss in the final network accuracy. We analyze the performance of our proposed methodology using three well-known networks for MNIST, CIFAR-10, and SVHN datasets, and we show that we are able to achieve up to 95% energy reduction with less than 1% accuracy loss across the three benchmarks. In addition, compared to prior work on dynamic network reconfiguration, we show that our approach leads to approximately 50% savings in storage requirements, while achieving similar accuracy.",

    "paper-abstract": "Large-scale controlled evacuations require emergency services to select evacuation routes, decide departure times, and mobilize resources to issue orders, all under strict time constraints. Existing algorithms almost always allow for preemptive evacuation schedules, which are less desirable in practice. This paper proposes, for the first time, a constraint-based scheduling model that optimizes the evacuation flow rate (number of vehicles sent at regular time intervals) and evacuation phasing of widely populated areas, while ensuring a nonpreemptive evacuation for each residential zone. Two optimization objectives are considered: (1) to maximize the number of evacuees reaching safety and (2) to minimize the overall duration of the evacuation. Preliminary results on a set of real-world instances show that the approach can produce, within a few seconds, a non-preemptive evacuation schedule which is either optimal or at most 6% away of the optimal preemptive solution.",

    "paper-abstract": "Assume that a multi-user multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system is designed from scratch to uniformly cover a given area with maximal energy efficiency (EE). What are the optimal number of antennas, active users, and transmit power? The aim of this paper is to answer this fundamental question. We consider jointly the uplink and downlink with different processing schemes at the base station and propose a new realistic power consumption model that reveals how the above parameters affect the EE. Closed-form expressions for the EE-optimal value of each parameter, when the other two are fixed, are provided for zero-forcing (ZF) processing in single-cell scenarios. These expressions prove how the parameters interact. For example, in sharp contrast to common belief, the transmit power is found to increase (not to decrease) with the number of antennas. This implies that energy-efficient systems can operate in high signal-to-noise ratio regimes in which interference-suppressing signal processing is mandatory. Numerical and analytical results show that the maximal EE is achieved by a massive MIMO setup wherein hundreds of antennas are deployed to serve a relatively large number of users using ZF processing. The numerical results show the same behavior under imperfect channel state information and in symmetric multi-cell scenarios.",

When the distance between Alice and Bob becomes large compared to the distance between Alice and Willie(s), the performance of covert communication will be degraded. In this case, multi-hop message transmission via intermediate relays can help to improve performance. Hence, in this work multi-hop covert communication over a moderate size network and in the presence of multiple collaborating Willies is considered. The relays can transmit covertly using either a single key for all relays, or different independent keys at the relays. For each case, we develop efficient algorithms to find optimal paths with maximum throughput and minimum end-to-end delay between Alice and Bob. As expected, employing multiple hops significantly improves the ability to communicate covertly versus the case of a single-hop transmission. Furthermore, at the expense of more shared key bits, analytical results and numerical simulations demonstrate that multi-hop covert communication with different independent keys at the relays has better performance than multi-hop covert communication with a single key.",

Working with data from a study in which participants were asked to rate the typicality of exemplars of a concept for different contexts, and introducing an exemplar typicality threshold, we built a SCOP model of how states of a concept arise differently in associative versus analytic (or divergent and convergent) modes of thought. Introducing measures of state robustness and context relevance, we show that by varying the threshold, the relevance of different contexts changes, and seemingly atypical states can become typical. The formalism provides a pivotal step toward a formal explanation of creative thought proesses.",
